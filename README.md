# WhitehouseHackathon

LDA, sentence structure visualization, debate clustering. Run the notebook to see everything and if you want to check out the visualization for sentence structure, download the sent_struct_vis folder and run the html file. The LDA visualization can't be seen unless you download the notebook, but if you want to get a quick glance at what it looks like just open the lda_vis.html file. Finally the clustering of a presidential debate is in the hackathon_clustering.py file and the "debate_cluster.png" file is the output. 

This was for the event linked below.
