[000:02:52;21] . 
[000:02:53;00] >> WE'RE ONE MINUTE AWAY.
[000:02:54;00] ONE MINUTE AWAY.
[000:03:50;18] LESTER HOLT:  GOOD EVENING FROM
[000:03:52;18] HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY IN 
[000:03:53;19] HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK.
[000:03:54;22] I'M LESTER HOLT, ANCHOR OF NBC 
[000:03:57;21] NIGHTLY NEWS.
[000:03:58;06] THE PARTICIPANTS TONIGHT ARE 
[000:03:59;23] DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY 
[000:04:01;27] CLINTON.
[000:04:02;09] THIS DEBATE IS SPONSORED BY THE
[000:04:04;22] COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL 
[000:04:06;22] DEBATES, A NONPARTIAL 
[000:04:08;22] NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION.
[000:04:09;23] A COMMISSIONER HAS DRAFTED THE 
[000:04:12;01] FORMAT AND THE RULES HAVE BEEN 
[000:04:13;07] AGREED TO.
[000:04:13;27] THE 90-MINUTE DEBATE IS DIVIDED
[000:04:16;01] INTO SIX SEGMENTS, EACH 15 
[000:04:18;01] MINUTES LONG.
[000:04:18;26] WE'LL EXPLORE THREE TOPIC AREAS
[000:04:21;27] TONIGHT: ACHIEVING PROSPERITY, 
[000:04:23;05] AMERICA'S DIRECTION, AND 
[000:04:25;00] SECURING AMERICA.
[000:04:25;17] AT THE START OF EACH SEGMENT, I
[000:04:27;05] WILL ASK THE SAME LEAD-OFF 
[000:04:29;05] QUESTION TO BOTH CANDIDATES, 
[000:04:30;05] AND THEY WILL EACH HAVE UP TO 
[000:04:31;07] TWO MINUTES TO RESPOND.
[000:04:33;00] FROM THAT POINT UNTIL THE END 
[000:04:35;01] OF THE SEGMENT, WE'LL HAVE AN 
[000:04:36;08] OPEN DISCUSSION.
[000:04:37;01] THE QUESTIONS ARE MINE, AND 
[000:04:39;04] HAVE NOT BEEN SHARED WITH THE 
[000:04:40;10] COMMISSION OR THE CAMPAIGN'S.
[000:04:41;14] THE AUDIENCE HERE IN THE ROOM 
[000:04:42;15] HAS AGREED TO REMAIN SILENT SO 
[000:04:44;13] THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT THE 
[000:04:45;17] CANDIDATES ARE SAYING.
[000:04:47;13] I WILL INVITE YOU TO APPLAUD, 
[000:04:49;13] HOWEVER, AT THIS MOMENT AS WE 
[000:04:51;11] WELCOME THE CANDIDATES, 
[000:04:58;19] DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR 
[000:04:59;17] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:05:00;11] HILLARY CLINTON, AND REPUBLICAN
[000:05:01;05] NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE 
[000:05:01;28] UNITED STATES, DONALD J. TRUMP.
[000:05:04;12] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
[000:05:18;19] DONALD TRUMP:  GOOD LUCK TO 
[000:05:20;24] YOU.
[000:05:29;23] LESTER HOLT:  WELL, I DON'T 
[000:05:30;15] EXPECT US TO COVER ALL THE 
[000:05:32;25] ISSUES OF THIS CAMPAIGN TONIGHT
[000:05:34;03] BUT I REMIND EVERYONE THERE ARE
[000:05:37;02] TWO MORE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES 
[000:05:38;25] SCHEDULED.
[000:05:39;08] WE WILL FOCUS ON THE ISSUES 
[000:05:41;00] VOTERS TELL US ARE MOST 
[000:05:42;02] IMPORTANT.
[000:05:42;27] I AM HONORED TO HAVE THIS ROLE 
[000:05:43;28] BUT THIS EVENING BELONGS TO THE
[000:05:45;09] CANDIDATES AND JUST AS 
[000:05:46;08] IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN 
[000:05:47;07] PEOPLE, CANDIDATES, WE LOOK 
[000:05:48;08] FORWARD TO HEARING YOU 
[000:05:50;03] ARTICULATE YOUR POLICIES AND 
[000:05:52;03] YOUR POSITIONS AS WELL AS YOUR 
[000:05:54;02] VISIONS AND YOUR VALUES.
[000:05:55;06] SO LET'S BEGIN.
[000:05:57;07] WE'RE CALLING THIS OPENING 
[000:05:58;09] SEGMENT "ACHIEVING PROSPERITY" 
[000:06:00;10] AND CENTRAL TO THAT IS JOBS.
[000:06:03;03] THERE ARE TWO ECONOMIC 
[000:06:04;07] REALITIES IN AMERICA TODAY.
[000:06:05;12] THERE'S BEEN A RECORD SIX 
[000:06:07;09] STRAIGHT YEARS OF JOB GROWTH 
[000:06:08;16] AND NEW CENSUS NUMBERS SHOW 
[000:06:11;12] INCOMES HAVE INCREASED AT A 
[000:06:12;12] RECORD RATE AFTER YEARS OF 
[000:06:14;10] STAGNATION.
[000:06:15;10] HOWEVER, INCOME INEQUALITY 
[000:06:17;13] REMAINS SIGNIFICANT AND NEARLY 
[000:06:18;13] HALF OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING 
[000:06:20;12] PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.
[000:06:21;19] BEGINNING WITH YOU SECRETARY 
[000:06:23;19] CLINTON, WHY ARE YOU A BETTER 
[000:06:24;25] CHOICE THAN YOUR OPPONENT TO 
[000:06:26;21] CREATE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT 
[000:06:27;24] WILL PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE 
[000:06:30;19] POCKETS OF AMERICAN WORKERS? 
[000:06:31;18] HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU 
[000:06:32;20] LESTER, AND THANKS TO HOFSTRA 
[000:06:34;00] FOR HOSTING US.
[000:06:36;22] THE CENTRAL QUESTION IN THIS 
[000:06:38;21] ELECTION IS REALLY WHAT KIND OF
[000:06:40;21] COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE AND WHAT 
[000:06:42;23] KIND OF FUTURE WE'LL BUILD 
[000:06:43;26] TOGETHER.
[000:06:44;22] TODAY IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S 
[000:06:46;03] SECOND BIRTHDAY, SO I THINK 
[000:06:47;29] ABOUT THIS A LOT.
[000:06:48;27] FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN 
[000:06:50;04] ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR 
[000:06:51;25] EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE
[000:06:53;25] TOP.
[000:06:54;05] THAT MEANS WE NEED NEW JOBS, 
[000:06:56;01] GOOD JOBS, WITH RISING INCOMES.
[000:06:58;02] I WANT US TO INVEST IN YOU.
[000:07:00;00] I WANT US TO INVEST IN YOUR 
[000:07:02;01] FUTURE.
[000:07:02;13] THAT MEANS JOBS IN 
[000:07:04;00] INFRASTRUCTURE, IN ADVANCED 
[000:07:06;03] MANUFACTURING, INNOVATION AND 
[000:07:08;04] TECHNOLOGY CLEAN RENEWABLE 
[000:07:10;03] ENERGY AND SMALL BUSINESS, 
[000:07:12;05] BECAUSE MOST OF THE NEW JOBS 
[000:07:13;16] WILL COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS.
[000:07:15;06] WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE 
[000:07:17;14] ECONOMY FAIRER.
[000:07:18;11] THAT STARTS WITH RAISING THE 
[000:07:20;10] NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE AND ALSO 
[000:07:23;12] GUARANTEE FINALLY EQUAL PAY FOR
[000:07:27;12] WOMENS' WORK.
[000:07:27;27] I ALSO WANT TO SEE MORE 
[000:07:29;13] COMPANIES DO PROFIT SHARING.
[000:07:30;19] IF YOU HELP CREATE THE PROFITS
[000:07:32;14] YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE IN 
[000:07:33;16] THEM, NOT JUST THE EXECUTIVES 
[000:07:34;22] AT THE TOP.
[000:07:35;17] AND I WANT US TO DO MORE TO 
[000:07:38;16] SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE 
[000:07:39;22] STRUGGLING TO BALANCE FAMILY 
[000:07:41;27] AND WORK.
[000:07:42;18] I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF YOU 
[000:07:44;20] ABOUT THE DIFFICULT CHOICES YOU
[000:07:46;21] FACE AND THE STRESSES THAT 
[000:07:48;22] YOU'RE UNDER.
[000:07:49;21] SO LET'S HAVE PAID FAMILY 
[000:07:51;20] LEAVE, EARNED SICK DAYS.
[000:07:52;24] LET'S BE SURE WE HAVE 
[000:07:53;28] AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE AND 
[000:07:55;23] DEBT-FREE COLLEGE.
[000:07:56;10] HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT? 
[000:07:57;25] WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY HAVING 
[000:07:59;24] THE WEALTHY PAY THEIR FAIR 
[000:08:01;02] SHARE AND CLOSE THE CORPORATE 
[000:08:02;24] LOOPHOLES.
[000:08:03;25] FINALLY, WE TONIGHT ARE ON THE 
[000:08:06;09] STAGE TOGETHER, DONALD TRUMP 
[000:08:08;28] AND I.
[000:08:09;29] DONALD, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH 
[000:08:13;00] YOU.
[000:08:13;10] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE 
[000:08:15;04] WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
[000:08:16;17] IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR 
[000:08:19;02] COUNTRY.
[000:08:19;14] YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US.
[000:08:21;03] WHO CAN SHOULDER THE IMMENSE 
[000:08:23;03] AWESOME RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE
[000:08:25;02] PRESIDENCY? 
[000:08:25;16] WHO CAN PUT INTO ACTION THE 
[000:08:27;09] PLANS THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE 
[000:08:29;06] BETTER? 
[000:08:29;18] I HOPE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO 
[000:08:32;06] EARN YOUR VOTE ON NOVEMBER 8TH.
[000:08:37;08] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[000:08:37;28] CLINTON, THANK YOU.
[000:08:38;17] MR. TRUMP, THE SAME QUESTION TO
[000:08:40;17] YOU.
[000:08:40;27] IT'S ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY 
[000:08:42;13] INTO AMERICAN WORKERS.
[000:08:43;17] YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
[000:08:45;13] DONALD TRUMP: THANK YOU, 
[000:08:46;13] LESTER.
[000:08:46;25] OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE 
[000:08:47;17] COUNTRY.
[000:08:47;29] THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO.
[000:08:48;19] THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER 
[000:08:50;18] COUNTRIES.
[000:08:51;01] YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING
[000:08:52;18] TO OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF 
[000:08:53;20] MAKING OUR PRODUCT.
[000:08:54;20] THEY'RE DEVALUING THEIR 
[000:08:57;16] CURRENCY AND THERE'S NOBODY IN 
[000:08:58;16] OUR GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT THEM 
[000:08:59;18] AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD FIGHT 
[000:09:00;22] AND WE HAVE A WINNING FIGHT, 
[000:09:01;27] BECAUSE THEY'RE USING OUR 
[000:09:03;18] COUNTRY AS A PIGGYBANK TO 
[000:09:05;19] REBUILD CHINA, AND MANY OTHER 
[000:09:06;27] COUNTRIES ARE DOING THE SAME 
[000:09:08;21] THING.
[000:09:09;02] SO WE'RE LOSING OUR GOOD JOBS, 
[000:09:10;28] SO MANY OF THEM.
[000:09:11;27] WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S 
[000:09:13;22] HAPPENING IN MEXICO, A FRIEND 
[000:09:15;26] OF MINE WHO BUILDS PLANTS SAID 
[000:09:17;24] IT'S THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE 
[000:09:19;23] WORLD.
[000:09:20;04] THEY'RE BUILDING SOME OF THE 
[000:09:21;25] BIGGEST PLANTS ANYWHERE IN THE 
[000:09:22;26] WORLD, SOME OF THE MOST 
[000:09:24;05] SOPHISTICATED AND BEST PLANTS.
[000:09:25;26] WITH THE UNITED STATES AS YOU 
[000:09:27;01] SAID NOT SO MUCH.
[000:09:28;04] SO FORD IS LEAVING.
[000:09:30;03] YOU SEE THAT THERE'S DIVISION, 
[000:09:33;29] LEAVING.
[000:09:34;11] THOUSANDS OF JOBS, LEAVING 
[000:09:36;04] MICHIGAN, LEAVING OHIO.
[000:09:37;05] THEY'RE ALL LEAVING AND WE 
[000:09:38;10] CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN 
[000:09:40;07] ANYMORE.
[000:09:40;19] AS FAR AS CHILDCARE IS 
[000:09:42;05] CONCERNED AND SO MANY OTHER 
[000:09:43;08] THINGS I THINK HILLARY AND I 
[000:09:44;18] AGREE ON THAT.
[000:09:45;10] WE PROBABLY DISAGREE A LITTLE 
[000:09:46;19] BIT AS TO NUMBERS AND AMOUNTS 
[000:09:48;12] AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, BUT
[000:09:50;12] PERHAPS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT 
[000:09:51;18] THAT LATER.
[000:09:52;11] BUT WE HAVE TO STOP OUR JOBS 
[000:09:55;12] FROM BEING STOLEN FROM US.
[000:09:58;10] WE HAVE TO STOP OUR COMPANIES 
[000:10:00;16] FROM LEAVING THE UNITED STATES 
[000:10:02;13] AND WITH IT, FIRING ALL OF 
[000:10:05;13] THEIR PEOPLE.
[000:10:05;28] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A 
[000:10:07;13] LOOK AT CARRIER AIR 
[000:10:09;13] CONDITIONING IN INDIANAPOLIS.
[000:10:11;21] THEY FIRED 1400 PEOPLE.
[000:10:13;16] THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO.
[000:10:14;12] SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS 
[000:10:15;13] OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS.
[000:10:17;16] WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN.
[000:10:19;15] UNDER MY PLAN, I WILL BE 
[000:10:22;18] REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY 
[000:10:24;22] FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, 
[000:10:28;22] SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES.
[000:10:30;18] THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB 
[000:10:31;21] CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN 
[000:10:33;20] SINCE RONALD REAGAN.
[000:10:34;26] IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL 
[000:10:36;01] THING TO WATCH.
[000:10:36;25] COMPANIES WILL COME.
[000:10:38;18] THEY WILL BUILD.
[000:10:39;04] THEY WILL EXPAND.
[000:10:39;27] NEW COMPANIES WILL START, AND I
[000:10:41;20] LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO
[000:10:42;29] DOING IT.
[000:10:43;24] WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR 
[000:10:45;00] TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP
[000:10:47;23] THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING 
[000:10:49;01] OUR COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS.
[000:10:52;27] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[000:10:53;17] CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
[000:10:54;26] RESPOND? 
[000:10:55;09] HILLARY CLINTON: I THINK THAT 
[000:10:56;02] RAID IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.
[000:10:57;00] OF COURSE, WE ARE 5% OF THE 
[000:10:58;03] WORLD'S POPULATION.
[000:10:59;05] WE HAVE TO TRADE WITH THE OTHER
[000:11:00;06] 95%, AND WE NEED TO HAVE SMART
[000:11:03;01] FAIR TRADE DEALS.
[000:11:04;28] WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A
[000:11:06;29] TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK 
[000:11:09;02] AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL 
[000:11:11;02] TRANSACTIONS.
[000:11:11;17] AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT 
[000:11:13;09] DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE 
[000:11:15;07] TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER
[000:11:16;18] AGAIN.
[000:11:17;08] IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST 
[000:11:18;13] EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST 
[000:11:21;11] TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENT OF
[000:11:23;16] THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN
[000:11:25;10] WE'VE EVER HAD.
[000:11:26;10] I CALL IT TRUMPED-UP TRICKLE 
[000:11:29;09] DOWN, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY 
[000:11:30;16] WHAT IT WOULD BE.
[000:11:31;12] THAT IS NOT HOW WE GROW THE 
[000:11:33;16] ECONOMY.
[000:11:33;28] WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW 
[000:11:35;22] ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR GROWING 
[000:11:37;19] THE ECONOMY, HOW WE MAKE 
[000:11:38;19] INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY 
[000:11:40;16] PRODUCE JOBS AND RISING 
[000:11:42;15] INCOMES.
[000:11:42;27] I THINK WE COME AT IT FROM 
[000:11:44;19] SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT 
[000:11:45;17] PERSPECTIVES.
[000:11:47;16] I UNDERSTAND THAT.
[000:11:48;18] YOU KNOW DONALD WAS VERY 
[000:11:50;18] FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE, AND 
[000:11:51;23] THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT.
[000:11:53;23] HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH 
[000:11:55;26] $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS 
[000:11:57;21] FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES 
[000:11:59;24] THAT THE MORE YOU HELP WEALTHY 
[000:12:01;24] PEOPLE, THE BETTER OFF WE'LL 
[000:12:02;29] BE, AND THAT EVERYTHING WILL 
[000:12:04;04] WORK OUT FROM THERE.
[000:12:04;29] I DON'T BUY THAT.
[000:12:06;25] I HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.
[000:12:08;01] MY FATHER WAS A SMALL 
[000:12:09;26] BUSINESSMAN.
[000:12:10;10] HE WORKED REALLY HARD.
[000:12:11;25] HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRICS ON 
[000:12:14;01] LONG TABLES WHERE YOU PULL OUT 
[000:12:16;02] THOSE FABRICS AND HE WENT DOWN 
[000:12:17;27] WITH THE SILK SCREEN AND DUMPED
[000:12:19;02] THE PAINT IN AND TOOK THE 
[000:12:21;02] SQUEEGEE AND KEPT GOING.
[000:12:22;04] SO WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE MORE 
[000:12:24;00] WE CAN DO FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS,
[000:12:25;02] THE MORE WE CAN INVEST IN YOU, 
[000:12:27;03] YOUR EDUCATION, YOUR SKILLS, 
[000:12:30;03] YOUR FUTURE, THE BETTER WE WILL
[000:12:31;18] BE OFF AND THE BETTER WE'LL 
[000:12:33;05] GROW.
[000:12:33;16] THAT'S THE KIND OF ECONOMY I 
[000:12:34;15] WANT US TO SEE AGAIN. 
[000:12:36;12] LESTER HOLT:  LET ME FOLLOW UP 
[000:12:37;12] WITH MR. TRUMP, IF I CAN.
[000:12:38;14] YOU TALKED ABOUT CREATING 25 
[000:12:40;08] MILLION JOBS AND YOU PROMISED 
[000:12:41;16] TO BRING BACK MILLIONS OF JOBS 
[000:12:43;10] FOR AMERICANS.
[000:12:43;25] HOW ARE WE GOING TO BRING BACK 
[000:12:45;11] THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE LEFT 
[000:12:46;13] THIS COUNTRY FOR CHEAPER LABOR 
[000:12:48;11] OVERSEAS? 
[000:12:49;28] HOW SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING 
[000:12:50;22] TO TELL AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS 
[000:12:51;24] THAT YOU HAVE TO COME BACK? 
[000:12:53;13] DONALD TRUMP: WELL, FOR ONE 
[000:12:54;13] THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON 
[000:12:56;15] THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY 
[000:12:57;21] SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT 
[000:12:59;19] IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH 
[000:13:01;18] MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
[000:13:03;13] WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST 
[000:13:04;13] ASSETS IN THE WORLD, AND I SAY 
[000:13:06;18] THAT ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE 
[000:13:07;26] KIND OF THINKING OUR COUNTRY 
[000:13:09;13] NEEDS.
[000:13:09;24] OUR COUNTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.
[000:13:10;20] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING 
[000:13:11;28] WHEN IT COMES TO DEVALUATIONS 
[000:13:13;22] AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES ALL 
[000:13:14;23] OVER THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY 
[000:13:15;25] CHINA, THEY'RE THE BEST, THE 
[000:13:17;19] BEST EVER AT IT.
[000:13:19;16] WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO US IS A 
[000:13:21;16] VERY, VERY SAD THING.
[000:13:22;21] SO WE HAVE TO DO THAT.
[000:13:23;19] WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR 
[000:13:25;20] TRADE DEALS.
[000:13:26;04] AND LESTER, THEY ARE TAKING OUR
[000:13:27;24] JOBS.
[000:13:28;17] THEY'RE GIVING INCENTIVES.
[000:13:30;19] THEY'RE DOING THINGS THAT 
[000:13:31;22] FRANKLY WE DON'T DO.
[000:13:32;20] LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF 
[000:13:34;20] MEXICO.
[000:13:35;02] THEY HAVE A VAT TAX.
[000:13:36;19] WE'RE ON A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.
[000:13:37;23] WHERE WE SELL INTO MEXICO IS A 
[000:13:40;23] TAX.
[000:13:41;03] WHERE THEY SELL AN AUTOMATIC 
[000:13:42;26] 16% APPROXIMATELY.
[000:13:43;22] WHEN THEY SELL INTO US, THERE'S
[000:13:45;00] NO TAX.
[000:13:45;26] IT'S A DEFECTIVE AGREEMENT.
[000:13:49;24] IT'S BEEN DEFECTIVE A LONG 
[000:13:51;00] TIME, MANY YEARS, BUT THE 
[000:13:52;24] POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE 
[000:13:53;15] ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
[000:13:54;02] NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO 
[000:13:55;27] SECRETARY CLINTON, YES -- IS 
[000:13:58;00] THAT OKAY? 
[000:13:58;28] GOOD.
[000:13:59;09] I WANT YOU TO BE VERY HAPPY.
[000:14:02;24] [LAUGHTER] 
[000:14:03;08] IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
[000:14:03;29] IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY 
[000:14:06;05] CLINTON, WHEN SHE STARTED 
[000:14:07;05] TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT WAS 
[000:14:08;04] REALLY VERY RECENTLY, SHE'S 
[000:14:09;08] BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS, 
[000:14:11;04] AND WHY HASN'T SHE MADE THE 
[000:14:13;00] AGREEMENTS BETTER? 
[000:14:13;18] THE NAFTA AGREEMENT IS 
[000:14:15;02] DEFECTIVE JUST BECAUSE OF THE 
[000:14:16;05] TAX AND MANY OTHER REASONS, BUT
[000:14:18;03] JUST BECAUSE OF THE TAX 
[000:14:19;03] LESTER HOLT:  LET ME INTERRUPT 
[000:14:21;08] JUST A MOMENT. 
[000:14:21;24] DONALD TRUMP: SECRETARY CLINTON
[000:14:22;18] AND OTHERS, AS POLITICIANS, 
[000:14:24;10] SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR
[000:14:25;04] YEARS, NOT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE 
[000:14:26;14] OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE CREATED 
[000:14:27;10] A MOVEMENT.
[000:14:28;10] THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING 
[000:14:29;02] THIS FOR YEARS.
[000:14:30;08] WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR JOBS AND
[000:14:32;11] OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ECONOMY 
[000:14:34;14] GENERALLY IS, LOOK, WE OWE $20 
[000:14:40;07] TRILLION.
[000:14:40;20] WE CANNOT DO IT ANY LONGER, 
[000:14:43;10] LESTER. 
[000:14:43;22] LESTER HOLT:  BACK TO THE 
[000:14:44;13] QUESTION, THOUGH.
[000:14:45;01] HOW DO YOU SPECIFICALLY BRING 
[000:14:45;24] BACK JOBS, AMERICAN 
[000:14:47;12] MANUFACTURERS, HOW DO YOU MAKE 
[000:14:48;11] THEM BRING THE JOBS BACK? 
[000:14:49;15] DONALD TRUMP: THE FIRST THING 
[000:14:50;13] YOU DO IS DON'T LET THE JOBS 
[000:14:51;22] LEAVE.
[000:14:52;03] THE COMPANIES ARE LEAVING.
[000:14:53;13] I COULD NAME -- THERE ARE 
[000:14:54;23] THOUSANDS OF THEM.
[000:14:55;18] THEY'RE LEAVING.
[000:14:56;19] AND THEY'RE LEAVING IN BIGGER 
[000:14:58;14] NUMBERS THAN EVER.
[000:14:59;01] AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAY, 
[000:15:00;18] FINE YOU WANT TO GO TO MEXICO 
[000:15:01;29] OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY, GOOD 
[000:15:03;15] LUCK.
[000:15:03;26] WE WISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK.
[000:15:04;18] BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING 
[000:15:06;21] TO MAKE YOUR AIR CONDITIONERS 
[000:15:07;28] OR YOUR CARS OR YOUR COOKIES OR
[000:15:10;18] WHATEVER YOU MAKE AND BRING 
[000:15:11;28] THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT A
[000:15:13;17] TAX, YOU'RE WRONG AND ONCE YOU 
[000:15:15;19] SAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAX
[000:15:16;24] THEM COMING IN -- AND OUR 
[000:15:17;27] POLITICIANS NEVER DO THIS, 
[000:15:19;26] BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL 
[000:15:21;00] INTERESTS AND THE SPECIAL 
[000:15:22;03] INTERESTS WANT THOSE COMPANIES 
[000:15:23;03] TO LEAVE BECAUSE IN MANY CASES 
[000:15:24;02] THEY OWN THE COMPANIES.
[000:15:26;01] SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE CAN 
[000:15:27;00] STOP THEM FROM LEAVING.
[000:15:28;24] WE HAVE TO STOP THEM FROM 
[000:15:30;00] LEAVING, AND THAT'S A BIG, BIG 
[000:15:31;29] FACTOR. 
[000:15:32;11] LESTER HOLT:  LET ME LET 
[000:15:34;27] SECRETARY CLINTON IN. 
[000:15:35;29] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, LET'S 
[000:15:36;24] STOP FOR A SECOND AND REMEMBER 
[000:15:38;25] WHERE WE WERE EIGHT YEARS AGO.
[000:15:41;01] WE HAD THE WORST FINANCIAL 
[000:15:42;03] CRISIS, THE GREAT RECESSION, 
[000:15:43;07] THE WORST SINCE THE 1930S.
[000:15:46;00] THAT WAS, IN LARGE PART, 
[000:15:47;07] BECAUSE OF TAX POLICIES THAT 
[000:15:49;02] SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, 
[000:15:51;07] FAILED TO INVEST IN THE MIDDLE 
[000:15:54;04] CLASS, TOOK THEIR EYES OFF OF 
[000:15:59;03] WALL STREET AND CREATED A 
[000:16:00;04] PERFECT STORM.
[000:16:00;19] IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE 
[000:16:02;09] PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE 
[000:16:03;11] HOUSING CRISIS.
[000:16:04;08] HE SAID BACK IN 2006: GEE I 
[000:16:08;08] HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE 
[000:16:09;15] THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME 
[000:16:11;09] AND MAKE SOME MONEY.
[000:16:12;08] WELL IT DID COLLAPSE. 
[000:16:14;11] DONALD TRUMP: THAT'S CALLED 
[000:16:15;05] BUSINESS, BY THE WAY. 
[000:16:16;11] HILLARY CLINTON: 9 MILLION 
[000:16:17;07] PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS.
[000:16:18;08] 5 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR 
[000:16:20;07] HOMES, AND 13 TRILLION DOLLARS 
[000:16:22;14] IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT.
[000:16:24;11] NOW, WE HAVE COME BACK FROM 
[000:16:26;20] THAT ABYSS, AND IT HAS NOT BEEN
[000:16:30;02] EASY SO WE'RE NOW ON THE 
[000:16:31;17] PRECIPICE OF HAVING A 
[000:16:33;14] POTENTIALLY MUCH BETTER 
[000:16:35;19] ECONOMY, BUT THE LAST THING WE 
[000:16:37;16] NEED TO DO IS TO GO BACK TO THE
[000:16:39;15] POLICIES THAT FAILED US IN THE 
[000:16:41;19] FIRST PLACE.
[000:16:42;20] INDEPENDENT EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED
[000:16:43;22] AT WHAT I'VE PROPOSED AND 
[000:16:45;18] LOOKED AT WHAT DONALD'S 
[000:16:47;21] PROPOSED AND BASICALLY THEY'VE
[000:16:49;01] SAID THIS, THAT IF HIS TAX 
[000:16:52;21] PLAN -- WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE
[000:16:54;21] DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION, AND 
[000:16:59;01] WOULD IN SOME INSTANCES 
[000:17:01;01] DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS 
[000:17:02;26] FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE 
[000:17:04;27] WEALTHY, WERE TO GO INTO 
[000:17:06;01] EFFECT WE WOULD LOSE 3.5 
[000:17:08;29] MILLION JOBS AND MAYBE HAVE 
[000:17:10;03] ANOTHER RECESSION.
[000:17:11;29] THEY'VE LOOKED AT MY PLAN AND 
[000:17:13;05] SAID, OKAY IF WE CAN DO 
[000:17:15;03] THIS -- AND I INTEND TO GET IT 
[000:17:16;09] DONE -- WE WILL HAVE 10 MILLION
[000:17:18;07] MORE NEW JOBS, BECAUSE WE WILL 
[000:17:20;08] BE MAKING INVESTMENTS WHERE WE 
[000:17:21;16] CAN GROW THE ECONOMY.
[000:17:23;04] TAKE CLEAN ENERGY.
[000:17:24;12] SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE
[000:17:26;10] CLEAN ENERGY SUPER POWER OF THE
[000:17:29;07] 21ST CENTURY.
[000:17:29;22] DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE 
[000:17:31;13] CHANGE IS A HOAX PERPETRATED BY
[000:17:33;20] THE CHINESE.
[000:17:34;16] I THINK IT'S REAL. 
[000:17:36;17] DONALD TRUMP: I DID NOT, I DO 
[000:17:37;15] NOT SAY THAT.
[000:17:39;12] HILLARY CLINTON: AND I THINK 
[000:17:40;05] IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GRIP 
[000:17:40;27] THIS AND DEAL WITH IT, BOTH AT 
[000:17:42;16] HOME AND ABROAD.
[000:17:43;18] AND HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO.
[000:17:44;16] WE CAN DEPLOY A HALF A BILLION 
[000:17:46;23] MORE SOLAR PANELS.
[000:17:48;16] WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY
[000:17:49;16] TO POWER EVERY HOME.
[000:17:50;19] WE CAN BUILD A NEW MODERN 
[000:17:52;20] ELECTRIC GRID.
[000:17:53;20] THAT'S A LOT OF JOBS.
[000:17:54;20] THAT'S A LOT OF NEW ECONOMIC 
[000:17:56;18] ACTIVITY.
[000:17:57;01] SO I'VE TRIED TO BE VERY 
[000:17:58;21] SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN AND 
[000:18:00;24] SHOULD DO, AND I AM DETERMINED 
[000:18:03;22] THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE 
[000:18:05;24] ECONOMY REALLY MOVING AGAIN, 
[000:18:06;27] BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE 
[000:18:08;05] MADE OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS,
[000:18:09;26] BUT NEVER GOING BACK TO WHAT 
[000:18:11;02] GOT US IN TROUBLE IN THE FIRST 
[000:18:13;00] PLACE. 
[000:18:13;12] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP? 
[000:18:14;23] DONALD TRUMP: SHE TALKS ABOUT 
[000:18:16;23] SOLAR PANELS.
[000:18:17;08] WE INVESTED IN THE SOLAR 
[000:18:21;25] COMPANY, OUR COUNTRY, THAT WAS 
[000:18:22;26] A DISASTER ON THAT ONE.
[000:18:24;00] NOW, LOOK, I'M A GREAT BIG 
[000:18:26;00] BELIEVER IN ALL FORMS OF ENERGY
[000:18:27;01] BUT WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF 
[000:18:28;06] PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.
[000:18:29;00] OUR ENERGY POLICIES ARE A 
[000:18:30;27] DISASTER.
[000:18:31;10] OUR COUNTRY IS LOSING SO MUCH 
[000:18:32;06] IN TERMS OF ENERGY, IN TERMS OF
[000:18:33;28] PAYING OFF OUR DEBT.
[000:18:35;01] YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU'RE 
[000:18:39;01] LOOKING TO DO WITH 20 TRILLION 
[000:18:41;08] IN DEBT.
[000:18:42;05] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, FROM 
[000:18:43;13] THE TIME THEY'VE COME IN, IS 
[000:18:45;02] OVER 230 YEARS' WORTH OF DEBT 
[000:18:48;02] AND HE'S TOPPED IT.
[000:18:49;04] HE'S DOUBLED IT IN THE COURSE 
[000:18:50;11] OF ALMOST EIGHT YEARS 7.5 
[000:18:52;06] YEARS TO BE SEMIEXACT.
[000:18:55;03] SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS.
[000:18:56;12] WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB
[000:18:59;10] AT KEEPING OUR JOBS, AND WE 
[000:19:01;13] HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT
[000:19:03;10] GIVING COMPANIES INCENTIVE TO 
[000:19:05;11] BUILD NEW COMPANIES OR TO 
[000:19:06;15] EXPAND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 
[000:19:07;15] DOING IT.
[000:19:08;06] AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK 
[000:19:10;05] AT MICHIGAN AND LOOK AT OHIO 
[000:19:12;07] AND LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PLACES
[000:19:14;06] WHERE SO MANY OF THEIR JOBS AND
[000:19:17;11] THEIR COMPANIES ARE JUST 
[000:19:20;07] LEAVING THEIR
[000:19:22;09] LEAVING, THEY'RE GONE.
[000:19:22;28] AND HILLARY, I ASK YOU THIS, 
[000:19:24;12] YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 
[000:19:26;06] YEARS.
[000:19:26;17] WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT
[000:19:27;16] THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? 
[000:19:29;09] FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING 
[000:19:32;14] IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING
[000:19:34;13] TO THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS.
[000:19:35;15] EXCUSE ME, I WILL BRING BACK 
[000:19:37;10] JOBS.
[000:19:37;21] YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. 
[000:19:38;19] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, 
[000:19:39;11] ACTUALLY, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT 
[000:19:40;11] THIS QUITE A BIT. 
[000:19:41;15] DONALD TRUMP: YEAH, FOR 30 
[000:19:42;12] YEARS? 
[000:19:43;10] [LAUGHTER] 
[000:19:43;24] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, NOT 
[000:19:44;16] QUITE THAT LONG.
[000:19:46;12] I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY
[000:19:47;17] GOOD JOB IN THE 1990S.
[000:19:48;16] I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED
[000:19:50;17] AND HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK 
[000:19:52;17] AGAIN.
[000:19:52;28] DONALD TRUMP: WELL HE APPROVED
[000:19:54;15] NAFTA.
[000:19:55;15] THE SINGLE WORST TRADE DEAL 
[000:19:56;23] EVER APPROVED. 
[000:19:57;21] HILLARY CLINTON: INCOMES WENT 
[000:19:58;18] UP FOR EVERYBODY.
[000:19:59;23] MANUFACTURING JOBS ALSO WENT UP
[000:20:00;25] IN THE 1990S, IF WE'RE ACTUALLY
[000:20:02;24] GOING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS.
[000:20:04;16] WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I HAD
[000:20:05;23] A NUMBER OF TRADE DEALS THAT 
[000:20:07;17] CAME BEFORE ME.
[000:20:08;18] AND I HELD THEM ALL TO THE SAME
[000:20:11;17] TEST.
[000:20:11;28] WILL THEY CREATE JOBS IN 
[000:20:12;25] AMERICA? 
[000:20:13;17] WILL THEY RAISE INCOMES IN 
[000:20:15;17] AMERICA? 
[000:20:16;00] AND ARE THEY GOOD FOR OUR 
[000:20:16;25] NATIONAL SECURITY? 
[000:20:17;25] SOME OF THEM I VOTED FOR.
[000:20:19;23] THE BIGGEST ONE, A 
[000:20:20;26] MULTINATIONAL ONE KNOWN AS 
[000:20:23;21] CAFTA, I VOTED AGAINST.
[000:20:25;27] AND BECAUSE I HOLD THE SAME 
[000:20:27;26] STANDARDS AS I LOOK AT ALL OF 
[000:20:29;25] THESE TRADE DEALS.
[000:20:30;23] BUT LET'S NOT ASSUME THAT TRADE
[000:20:32;28] IS THE ONLY CHALLENGE WE HAVE 
[000:20:34;24] IN THE ECONOMY.
[000:20:36;01] I THINK IT IS A PART OF IT, AND
[000:20:37;29] I'VE SAID WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
[000:20:39;26] I'M GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL 
[000:20:41;02] PROSECUTOR.
[000:20:41;25] WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THE 
[000:20:42;28] TRADE DEALS WE HAVE, AND WE'RE 
[000:20:44;01] GOING TO HOLD PEOPLE 
[000:20:44;29] ACCOUNTABLE.
[000:20:45;26] WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, 
[000:20:47;01] WE ACTUALLY INCREASED AMERICAN 
[000:20:50;02] EXPORTS GLOBALLY 30%.
[000:20:55;00] WE INCREASED THEM TO CHINA 50%.
[000:20:57;02] SO I KNOW HOW TO REALLY WORK TO
[000:20:59;01] GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS
[000:21:00;06] THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW 
[000:21:05;00] JOBS
[000:21:05;20] JOBS. 
[000:21:06;01] DONALD TRUMP: BUT YOU HAVEN'T 
[000:21:06;27] DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 
[000:21:07;19] YEARS. 
[000:21:08;01] HILLARY CLINTON: I'VE BEEN A 
[000:21:09;00] SENATOR. 
[000:21:09;13] DONALD TRUMP: YOU HAVEN'T DONE 
[000:21:10;07] IT. 
[000:21:10;17] HILLARY CLINTON: AND I HAVE 
[000:21:11;09] BEEN A SECRETARY OF STATE AND I
[000:21:12;05] HAVE DONE IT. 
[000:21:13;04] DONALD TRUMP: YOUR HUSBAND 
[000:21:14;03] SIGNED NAFTA WHICH WAS ONE OF 
[000:21:15;04] THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER 
[000:21:16;07] HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING 
[000:21:17;10] INDUSTRY. 
[000:21:17;23] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS YOUR 
[000:21:18;17] OPINION. 
[000:21:19;00] DONALD TRUMP: YOU GO TO NEW 
[000:21:19;23] ENGLAND, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, 
[000:21:20;16] YOU GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, 
[000:21:22;10] SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL
[000:21:24;06] SEE DEVASTATION, WHERE 
[000:21:26;11] MANUFACTURING IS DOWN 30 40, 
[000:21:27;12] SOMETIMES 50%.
[000:21:30;09] NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL 
[000:21:31;21] MAYBE EVER SIGNED ANYWHERE BUT 
[000:21:33;11] CERTAINLY EVER SIGNED IN THIS 
[000:21:34;12] COUNTRY AND NOW YOU WANT TO 
[000:21:36;15] APPROVE TRANSPACIFIC 
[000:21:37;18] PARTNERSHIP.
[000:21:38;02] YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF 
[000:21:39;13] IT.
[000:21:39;23] THEN YOU HEARD WHAT I WAS 
[000:21:40;15] SAYING, HOW BAD IT IS, AND YOU 
[000:21:41;22] SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE.
[000:21:43;19] BUT YOU KNOW THAT IF DID YOU 
[000:21:44;21] WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT, 
[000:21:51;20] AND THAT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD
[000:21:52;14] AS NAFTA.
[000:21:52;27] NOTHING WILL EVER TOP NAFTA. 
[000:21:53;20] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, THAT IS 
[000:21:54;14] JUST NOT ACCURATE.
[000:21:55;01] I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS 
[000:21:56;28] FINALLY NEGOTIATED AND THE 
[000:21:57;28] TERMS WERE LAID OUT.
[000:21:58;25] I WROTE ABOUT THAT IN -- 
[000:22:00;00] DONALD TRUMP: YOU CALLED IT THE
[000:22:01;24] GOLD STANDARD.
[000:22:02;26] YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD
[000:22:03;28] OF TRADE DEALS.
[000:22:04;25] YOU SAID IT'S THE FINEST DEAL 
[000:22:06;24] YOU'VE EVER SEEN. 
[000:22:07;11] HILLARY CLINTON: NO. 
[000:22:08;00] DONALD TRUMP: AND THEN YOU 
[000:22:08;22] HEARD WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT AND 
[000:22:09;27] ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WERE 
[000:22:10;18] AGAINST IT. 
[000:22:11;04] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, DONALD, 
[000:22:11;28] I KNOW YOU LIVE IN YOUR OWN 
[000:22:14;00] REALITY 
[000:22:14;27] [LAUGHTER] 
[000:22:15;11] BUT THAT IS NOT THE FACT.
[000:22:16;28] THE FACTS ARE, I DID SAY I 
[000:22:19;00] HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL 
[000:22:20;01] BUT WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED 
[000:22:21;13] WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE 
[000:22:23;01] FOR, I INCLUDED IT WASN'T.
[000:22:24;10] I WROTE ABOUT THAT 
[000:22:25;05] DONALD TRUMP: SO IS IT 
[000:22:26;06] PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? 
[000:22:28;00] IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT. 
[000:22:30;05] HILLARY CLINTON: I WROTE THAT 
[000:22:30;28] BEFORE YOU EVEN ANNOUNCED. 
[000:22:32;10] DONALD TRUMP: IS IT PRESIDENT 
[000:22:33;10] OBAMA'S FAULT? 
[000:22:33;26] BECAUSE HE'S PUSHING IT. 
[000:22:35;07] HILLARY CLINTON: THERE ARE 
[000:22:35;29] DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHAT'S 
[000:22:37;09] GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY, OUR 
[000:22:39;05] ECONOMY, AND OUR LEADERSHIP IN 
[000:22:41;11] THE WORLD.
[000:22:41;24] AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
[000:22:43;08] LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO 
[000:22:45;10] GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN.
[000:22:46;17] THAT'S WHY I'VE SAID NEW JOBS 
[000:22:48;13] WITH RISING INCOMES, 
[000:22:50;11] INVESTMENTS, NOT IN MORE TAX 
[000:22:52;12] CUTS THAT WOULD ADD 5 TRILLION 
[000:22:54;12] DOLLARS TO THE DEBT. 
[000:22:56;18] DONALD TRUMP: BUT YOU HAVE NO 
[000:22:57;13] PLAN. 
[000:22:57;24] HILLARY CLINTON: OH, I DO. 
[000:22:58;16] DONALD TRUMP: SECRETARY, YOU 
[000:22:59;21] HAVE NO PLAN. 
[000:23:00;17] HILLARY CLINTON: I HAVE WRITTEN
[000:23:01;11] A BOOK ABOUT IT.
[000:23:01;29] IT'S CALLED "STRONGER 
[000:23:03;14] TOGETHER."
[000:23:04;14] YOU CAN PICK IT UP TOMORROW AT 
[000:23:05;18] A BOOK STORE OR AN AIRPORT NEAR
[000:23:07;19] YOU.
[000:23:07;29] BUT IT'S BECAUSE I SEE THIS.
[000:23:09;19] WE NEED TO HAVE STRONG GROWTH, 
[000:23:11;24] FAIR GROWTH, SUSTAINED GROWTH.
[000:23:12;25] WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE 
[000:23:15;21] HELP FAMILIES BALANCE THEIR 
[000:23:17;18] RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME AND 
[000:23:19;21] THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
[000:23:21;21] BUSINESS.
[000:23:22;04] SO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST SET OF
[000:23:23;21] PLANS, AND PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED 
[000:23:24;27] AT BOTH OF OUR PLANS, HAVE 
[000:23:27;19] CONCLUDED THAT MINE WOULD 
[000:23:28;24] CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS AND 
[000:23:30;20] YOURS WOULD LOSE US 3.5 MILLION
[000:23:34;05] JOBS AND EXPOSE US -- 
[000:23:40;22] DONALD TRUMP: YOU ARE GOING TO 
[000:23:42;02] APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX 
[000:23:42;26] CUTS IN HISTORY.
[000:23:43;12] YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF
[000:23:44;06] THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASES IN 
[000:23:44;29] HISTORY.
[000:23:45;11] YOU ARE GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESS
[000:23:46;05] OUT.
[000:23:46;15] YOUR REGULATIONS ARE A 
[000:23:47;07] DISASTER AND YOU'RE GOING TO 
[000:23:48;02] INCREASE REGULATIONS ALL OVER 
[000:23:49;26] THE PLACE.
[000:23:50;09] AND BY THE WAY, MY TAX CUT IS 
[000:23:52;24] THE BIGGEST SINCE RONALD 
[000:23:53;29] REAGAN.
[000:23:54;22] I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.
[000:23:55;26] IT WILL CREATE TREMENDOUS 
[000:23:56;28] NUMBERS OF NEW JOBS.
[000:23:57;29] BUT REGULATIONS, YOU ARE GOING 
[000:23:59;27] TO REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES 
[000:24:01;02] OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[000:24:01;29] WHEN I GO AROUND -- LESTER, I 
[000:24:03;28] TELL YOU THIS.  I'VE BEEN ALL 
[000:24:05;01] OVER.
[000:24:05;23] AND WHEN I GO AROUND, DESPITE 
[000:24:08;03] THE TAX CUT THE THINGS THAT 
[000:24:11;28] BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE 
[000:24:13;26] MOST IS THE FACT THAT I'M 
[000:24:14;27] CUTTING REGULATION.
[000:24:15;15] YOU HAVE REGULATIONS ON TOP OF 
[000:24:17;28] REGULATIONS, AND NEW COMPANIES 
[000:24:20;03] CANNOT FORM AND OLD COMPANIES 
[000:24:22;00] ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, AND 
[000:24:23;04] YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE 
[000:24:24;28] REGULATIONS AND MAKE THEM EVEN 
[000:24:26;01] WORSE.
[000:24:26;12] I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS.
[000:24:28;04] I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES, 
[000:24:31;01] BIG-LEAGUE, AND YOU ARE GOING 
[000:24:32;06] TO RAISE TAXES BIG-LEAGUE, END 
[000:24:34;10] OF STORY. 
[000:24:35;06] LESTER HOLT:  LET ME GET YOU TO
[000:24:36;03] PAUSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WE'RE
[000:24:36;27] GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT 
[000:24:39;02] SEGMENT. 
[000:24:39;15] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT CAN'T 
[000:24:40;08] BE -- I KIND OF ASSUMED THAT 
[000:24:43;06] THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF THESE 
[000:24:44;03] CHARGES AND CLAIMS, AND SO -- 
[000:24:48;09] DONALD TRUMP: FACTS.
[000:24:49;09] >> WE HAVE TAKEN THE HOME PAGE 
[000:24:51;10] OF MY WEB SITE 
[000:24:53;06] HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND TURNED 
[000:24:54;13] IT INTO A FACT CHECKER.
[000:24:56;14] SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE IN REAL 
[000:24:57;12] TIME WHAT THE FACTS ARE, PLEASE
[000:24:59;08] GO AND TAKE A LOOK. 
[000:25:00;11] DONALD TRUMP: AND TAKE A LOOK 
[000:25:01;18] AT MINE ALSO. 
[000:25:03;14] HILLARY CLINTON: IT WILL NOT 
[000:25:04;15] ADD A PENNY TO THE DEBT AND 
[000:25:06;14] YOUR PLANS WOULD ADD $5 
[000:25:09;13] TRILLION TO THE DEBT.
[000:25:10;15] WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED WOULD CUT 
[000:25:12;14] REGULATIONS AND STREAMLINED 
[000:25:13;18] THEM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
[000:25:15;13] WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED WOULD BE 
[000:25:17;15] PAID FOR BY RAISING TAXES ON 
[000:25:20;16] THE WEALTHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
[000:25:22;18] MADE ALL THE GAINS IN THE 
[000:25:25;19] ECONOMY AND I THINK IT'S TIME 
[000:25:27;17] THAT THE WEALTHY INCORPORATIONS
[000:25:28;17] PAID THEIR FAIR SHARE TO 
[000:25:30;18] SUPPORT THIS. 
[000:25:31;03] LESTER HOLT:  YOU JUST OPENED 
[000:25:31;28] THE NEXT SEGMENT. 
[000:25:32;25] DONALD TRUMP: COULD I JUST 
[000:25:34;18] FINISH? 
[000:25:35;00] IF YOU GO TO OUR WEB SITE.
[000:25:36;27] TAKE A LOOK AT OUR WEB SITE.
[000:25:38;18] SHE'S GOING TO RAISE TAXES 1.3 
[000:25:40;18] TRILLION DOLLARS.
[000:25:41;19] AND LOOK AT HER WEB SITE.
[000:25:42;22] YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO 
[000:25:43;25] DIFFERENT THAN THIS.
[000:25:45;22] SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT 
[000:25:48;26] ISIS.
[000:25:49;19] GO TO HER WEB SITE.
[000:25:50;25] SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT 
[000:25:53;22] ISIS.
[000:25:54;03] I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS 
[000:25:55;23] MACARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO 
[000:25:56;29] MUCH. 
[000:25:57;10] HILLARY CLINTON: AT LEAST I 
[000:25:58;03] HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. 
[000:25:59;05] DONALD TRUMP: NO, NO.
[000:26:00;00] YOU'RE TELLING THE ECONOMY 
[000:26:02;00] EVERYTHING YOU'RE WANTING TO 
[000:26:02;27] DO. 
[000:26:03;07] HILLARY CLINTON: NO WE'RE NOT. 
[000:26:04;01] DONALD TRUMP: YOU'RE TELLING 
[000:26:04;28] THE ECONOMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT
[000:26:05;26] TO DO.   NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN 
[000:26:07;28] FIGHTING ISIS YOUR ENTIRE ADULT
[000:26:09;28] LIFE.
[000:26:10;09] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT'S A -- GO
[000:26:13;02] TO THE FACT CHECKERS.
[000:26:14;05] GO TO WORK. 
[000:26:15;04] LESTER HOLT:  WE ARE UNPACKING 
[000:26:16;11] A LOT HERE AND WE'RE STILL ON 
[000:26:18;04] THE ISSUE OF ACHIEVING 
[000:26:19;02] PROSPERITY AND I WANT TO TALK 
[000:26:20;07] ABOUT TAXES, THE FUNDAMENTAL 
[000:26:21;16] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF 
[000:26:23;03] YOU CONCERNS THE WEALTHY.
[000:26:24;03] SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE 
[000:26:24;24] CALLING FOR A TAX INCREASE ON 
[000:26:26;15] THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.
[000:26:27;14] I'D LIKE YOU TO FURTHER DEFEND 
[000:26:29;08] THAT AND MR. TRUMP, YOU'RE 
[000:26:30;10] CALLING FOR TAX CUTS FOR THE 
[000:26:32;03] WEALTHY.
[000:26:32;15] I'D LIKE YOU TO DEFEND THAT IN 
[000:26:34;06] THIS NEXT TWO MINUTE ANSWER 
[000:26:35;12] GOES TO YOU, MR. TRUMP. 
[000:26:37;11] DONALD TRUMP: WELL, I'M REALLY 
[000:26:39;08] CALLING FOR MAJOR JOBS BECAUSE 
[000:26:40;14] THE WEALTHY ARE GOING TO CREATE
[000:26:42;12] TREMENDOUS JOBS.
[000:26:42;28] THEY'RE GOING TO EXPAND THEIR 
[000:26:43;22] COMPANYS AND DO A TREMENDOUS 
[000:26:44;19] JOB.
[000:26:45;10] I'M GETTING RID OF THE CARRIED 
[000:26:47;11] INTEREST PROVISION AND IF YOU 
[000:26:48;14] REALLY LOOK, IT'S REALLY NOT A 
[000:26:50;13] GREAT THING FOR THE WEALTHY.
[000:26:52;17] IT'S A GREAT THING FOR MIDDLE 
[000:26:53;21] CLASS AND IT'S A GREAT THING 
[000:26:55;16] FOR COMPANIES TO EXPAND AND 
[000:26:56;19] WHEN THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING 
[000:26:57;24] TO PUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF
[000:26:59;15] DOLLARS INTO COMPANIES AND WHEN
[000:27:01;17] THEY'RE GOING TO BRING 2.5 
[000:27:02;20] TRILLION DOLLARS BACK FROM 
[000:27:04;18] OVERSEAS THEY CAN'T BRING THE 
[000:27:06;22] MONEY BACK BECAUSE POLITICIANS 
[000:27:08;20] LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON WON'T 
[000:27:09;20] ALLOW THEM TO BRING THE MONEY 
[000:27:10;24] BACK BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE SO 
[000:27:14;22] OWNEROUS AND THE BUREAUCRAT RED
[000:27:16;24] TAPE IS SO BAD, SO WHAT THEY'RE
[000:27:18;00] DOING IS LEAVING OUR COMPANY, 
[000:27:19;02] AND THEY'RE BELIEVE IT OR NOT 
[000:27:20;03] LEAVING BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO 
[000:27:21;27] HIGH AND BECAUSE SOME OF THEM 
[000:27:23;01] HAVE LOTS OF MONEY OUTSIDE OF 
[000:27:24;27] OUR COUNTRY AND INSTEAD OF 
[000:27:25;28] BRINGING IT BACK AND PUTTING 
[000:27:27;04] THE MONEY TO WORK BECAUSE THEY 
[000:27:28;27] CAN'T WORK OUT A DEAL IT -- AND
[000:27:30;01] EVERYBODY AGREES IT SHOULD BE 
[000:27:33;29] BROUGHT BACK, INSTEAD OF THAT, 
[000:27:36;01] THEY'RE LEAVING OUR COUNTRY TO 
[000:27:36;25] GET THEIR MONEY BECAUSE THEY 
[000:27:38;01] CAN'T BRING THEIR MONEY BACK 
[000:27:39;04] INTO OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF 
[000:27:41;04] BUREAUCRAT RED TAPE BECAUSE 
[000:27:42;02] THEY CAN'T GET TOGETHER.
[000:27:43;00] BECAUSE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT 
[000:27:44;02] THAT CAN'T SIT THEM AROUND A 
[000:27:46;04] TABLE AND GET THEM TO APPROVE 
[000:27:47;07] SOMETHING AND HERE'S THE THING
[000:27:50;01] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREE
[000:27:52;01] THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE.
[000:27:54;01] 2.5 TRILLION.
[000:27:54;29] I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S DOUBLE 
[000:27:57;02] THAT. IT'S PROBABLY $5 TRILLION
[000:27:59;05] THAT WE CAN'T BRING INTO OUR 
[000:28:01;02] COUNTRY, LESTER AND WITH A 
[000:28:02;05] LITTLE LEADERSHIP, YOU'D GET IT
[000:28:03;06] IN HERE VERY QUICKLY AND IT 
[000:28:05;07] COULD BE PUT TO USE ON THE 
[000:28:06;16] INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER 
[000:28:08;07] THINGS AND IT WOULD BE 
[000:28:09;12] BEAUTIFUL, BUT WE HAVE NO 
[000:28:12;04] LEADERSHIP.
[000:28:12;18] AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH 
[000:28:14;08] SECRETARY CLINTON. 
[000:28:14;26] LESTER HOLT:  YOU HAVE TWO 
[000:28:15;18] MINUTES ON THE SAME QUESTION TO
[000:28:17;04] DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE 
[000:28:19;07] WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY
[000:28:20;06] CLINTON. 
[000:28:20;19] HILLARY CLINTON: I HAVE A 
[000:28:21;10] FEELING BY THE END OF THIS 
[000:28:22;07] EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED 
[000:28:23;15] FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER 
[000:28:25;06] HAPPENED. 
[000:28:25;19] DONALD TRUMP: WHY NOT? 
[000:28:26;12] [LAUGHTER] 
[000:28:26;26] HILLARY CLINTON: YEAH, WHY NOT?
[000:28:28;11] YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE 
[000:28:31;15] BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS.
[000:28:36;09] DONALD TRUMP: THERE'S NOTHING 
[000:28:37;13] CRAZY ABOUT NOT LETTING OUR 
[000:28:39;11] COMPANIES BRING THEIR MONEY 
[000:28:40;14] BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY. 
[000:28:42;16] LESTER HOLT:  THIS IS SECRETARY
[000:28:43;12] CLINTON'S TWO MINUTES, PLEASE. 
[000:28:44;17] HILLARY CLINTON: LET'S START 
[000:28:45;14] THE CLOCK AGAIN, LESTER.
[000:28:47;17] WE'VE LOOKED AT YOUR TAX 
[000:28:49;16] PROPOSALS.
[000:28:50;13] I DON'T SEE CHANGES IN THE 
[000:28:51;23] CORPORATE TAX RATES OR THE 
[000:28:54;16] KINDS OF PROPOSALS YOU'RE 
[000:28:55;22] REFERRING TO THAT WOULD CAUSE A
[000:28:58;15] REPATRIATION BRINGING BACK OF 
[000:29:00;17] MONEY THAT'S STRANDED OVERSEAS.
[000:29:03;21] I HAPPEN TO SUPPORT THAT.
[000:29:04;25] I HAPPEN TO SUPPORT THAT IN A 
[000:29:06;20] WAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK TO 
[000:29:08;21] OUR BENEFIT.
[000:29:09;20] BUT WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT YOU 
[000:29:10;23] HAVE PROPOSED, YOU HAVE WHAT IS
[000:29:14;18] CALLED NOW THE TRUMP LOOPHOLE 
[000:29:16;21] BECAUSE IT WOULD SO ADVANTAGE 
[000:29:17;25] YOU AND THE BUSINESS YOU DO.
[000:29:20;20] YOU'VE PROPOSED AN APPROACH -- 
[000:29:22;26] DONALD TRUMP: WHO GIVE GAVE IT 
[000:29:26;22] THAT. 
[000:29:27;03] HILLARY CLINTON: -- YOU'VE 
[000:29:30;20] PRESENTED A $4 BILLION TAX 
[000:29:31;22] BENEFIT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
[000:29:32;26] DONALD TRUMP: HOW MUCH FOR MY 
[000:29:33;28] FAMILY? 
[000:29:34;19] HILLARY CLINTON: AS I SAID, 
[000:29:36;22] LESTER, IT IS TRUMPED UP 
[000:29:37;25] TRICKLE DOWN.
[000:29:39;21] TRICKLE DOWN DID NOT WORK.
[000:29:40;23] IT GOT US INTO THE MESS WE WERE
[000:29:43;23] IN IN 2008 AND 2009.
[000:29:45;24] SLASHING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY 
[000:29:47;25] HASN'T WORKED AND A LOT OF 
[000:29:49;02] REALLY SMART, WEALTHY PEOPLE 
[000:29:50;09] KNOW THAT, AND THEY ARE SAYING
[000:29:51;29] HEY, WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE
[000:29:54;00] THE CONTRIBUTIONS WE SHOULD BE 
[000:29:56;03] MAKING TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE 
[000:29:57;07] CLASS.
[000:29:58;01] I DON'T THINK TOP-DOWN WORKS IN
[000:30:00;01] AMERICA.
[000:30:00;13] I THINK BUILDING THE MIDDLE 
[000:30:02;02] CLASS, INVESTING IN THE MIDDLE 
[000:30:04;03] CLASS, MAKING COLLEGE DEBT-FREE
[000:30:06;10] SO MORE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET 
[000:30:07;11] THEIR EDUCATION, HELPING PEOPLE
[000:30:10;04] REFINANCE THEIR TAX, THEIR DEBT
[000:30:12;08] FROM COLLEGE AT A LOWER RATE.
[000:30:14;08] THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS 
[000:30:15;09] THAT WILL REALLY BOOST THE 
[000:30:17;11] ECONOMY.
[000:30:18;07] BROAD-BASED, INCLUSIVE GROWTH 
[000:30:19;18] IS WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA, NOT
[000:30:22;18] MORE ADVANTAGES FOR PEOPLE AT 
[000:30:23;17] THE VERY TOP.
[000:30:26;11] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP. 
[000:30:27;14] DONALD TRUMP: TYPICAL 
[000:30:29;10] POLITICIAN, ALL TALK, NO 
[000:30:30;15] ACTION SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T 
[000:30:33;15] WORK, NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
[000:30:35;14] OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING 
[000:30:37;17] BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY 
[000:30:39;17] CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH BAD 
[000:30:41;21] DECISIONS IN TERMS OF OUR JOBS 
[000:30:43;27] AND IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING 
[000:30:46;18] ON.
[000:30:46;28] NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST 
[000:30:48;19] REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE
[000:30:49;24] GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE 
[000:30:52;03] ME WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT 
[000:30:53;27] NOW, AND THE ONLY THING THAT 
[000:30:55;04] LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET.
[000:30:56;20] BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES
[000:30:58;01] EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING
[000:30:59;23] TO COME CRASHING DOWN.
[000:31:00;21] WE ARE IN A BIG FAT UGLY 
[000:31:03;22] BUBBLE, AND WE'D BETTER BE 
[000:31:05;02] AWFULLY CAREFUL, AND WE HAVE A 
[000:31:06;25] FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL 
[000:31:08;22] THINGS.
[000:31:09;04] THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, 
[000:31:13;01] THIS FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY 
[000:31:15;03] KEEPING INTEREST RATES AT THIS 
[000:31:16;09] LEVEL AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY 
[000:31:18;04] OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES 
[000:31:19;10] AND GOES OFF TO THE GOLF COURSE
[000:31:21;06] THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY 
[000:31:22;07] GOLF WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST 
[000:31:24;06] RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME
[000:31:25;06] VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE 
[000:31:26;19] THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB.
[000:31:28;06] THE FED IS BEING MORE POLITICAL
[000:31:30;10] THAN SECRETARY CLINTON.
[000:31:31;12] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, WE'RE 
[000:31:32;12] TALKING ABOUT THE BURDEN THAT 
[000:31:33;11] AMERICANS HAVE TO PAY, YET YOU 
[000:31:36;11] HAVE NOT RELEASED YOUR TAX 
[000:31:38;06] RETURNS.
[000:31:38;18] AND THE REASON NOMINEES HAVE 
[000:31:39;11] RELEASED THEIR RETURNS FOR 
[000:31:41;11] DECADES IS SO THAT VOTERS WILL 
[000:31:43;09] KNOW IF THEIR POTENTIAL 
[000:31:44;17] PRESIDENT OWES MONEY, WHO HE 
[000:31:48;09] OWES IT TO AND ANY BUSINESS 
[000:31:51;08] CONFLICTS.
[000:31:51;21] DON'T AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO
[000:31:52;15] KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CONFLICTS
[000:31:54;13] OF INTEREST? 
[000:31:55;14] DONALD TRUMP: I DON'T MIND 
[000:31:57;09] RELEASING.
[000:31:57;22] I'M UNDER A ROUTINE AUDIT, AND 
[000:31:59;11] AS SOON AS THE AUDITS ARE 
[000:32:00;12] FINISHED IT WILL BE RELEASED.
[000:32:01;18] YOU WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT 
[000:32:02;23] DONALD TRUMP BY GOING DOWN TO 
[000:32:03;20] THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS WHERE I 
[000:32:05;12] FILED A 104-PAGE, ESSENTIALLY, 
[000:32:08;19] FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF SORTS, 
[000:32:09;16] THE FORMS THAT THEY HAVE.
[000:32:11;17] IT SHOWS INCOME -- IN FACT, THE
[000:32:13;12] INCOME, I JUST LOOKED TODAY, 
[000:32:15;17] THE INCOME IS FILED AT $694 
[000:32:20;15] MILLION FOR THIS PAST YEAR.
[000:32:21;19] $694 MILLION.
[000:32:22;18] YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I WAS 
[000:32:24;16] GOING TO MAKE THAT 15 OR 20 
[000:32:25;17] YEARS AGO, I WOULD HAVE BEEN 
[000:32:26;27] VERY SURPRISED.
[000:32:27;13] BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING
[000:32:28;16] THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS.
[000:32:29;17] WHEN WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S 
[000:32:30;25] DOING SO BADLY THAT'S BEING 
[000:32:33;20] RIPPED OFF BY EVERY SINGLE 
[000:32:35;20] COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, IT'S THE 
[000:32:37;21] KIND OF THINKING THAT OUR 
[000:32:39;03] COUNTRY NEEDS, BECAUSE 
[000:32:41;01] EVERYBODY -- LESTER WE HAVE A 
[000:32:43;01] TRADE DEFICIT WITH ALL OF THE 
[000:32:45;28] COUNTRIES THAT WE DO BUSINESS 
[000:32:47;29] WITH OF ALMOST $800 BILLION A 
[000:32:50;01] YEAR.
[000:32:50;12] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 
[000:32:51;24] THAT MEANS WHO'S NEGOTIATING 
[000:32:53;02] THESE TRADE DEALS? 
[000:32:54;29] WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
[000:32:56;27] POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR
[000:32:58;04] TRADE DEALS. 
[000:32:59;02] LESTER HOLT:  THE I.R.S. HAS AN
[000:33:01;04] AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES.
[000:33:04;01] YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO 
[000:33:05;00] RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN 
[000:33:06;12] AUDIT.
[000:33:07;01] DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW
[000:33:09;05] OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- 
[000:33:10;04] DONALD TRUMP: I WILL RELEASE 
[000:33:11;09] THEM AS SOON AS THE 
[000:33:12;03] AUDIT -- I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT 
[000:33:14;06] ALMOST 15 YEARS.
[000:33:15;05] I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE 
[000:33:17;07] THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED.
[000:33:18;08] I SAID DO YOU GET AUDITED? 
[000:33:21;05] I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY 
[000:33:22;08] YEAR.
[000:33:22;19] IN A WAY I SHOULD BE 
[000:33:25;07] COMPLAINING.
[000:33:25;21] I DON'T COMPLAIN, IN A WAY, -- A
[000:33:29;19] LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET 
[000:33:31;09] AUDITED.
[000:33:31;21] I WILL SAY THIS.
[000:33:32;12] WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS 
[000:33:33;12] COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN 
[000:33:34;18] CARE OF.
[000:33:35;12] I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS 
[000:33:37;16] AGAINST MY LAWYERS' WISHES.
[000:33:39;17] WHEN SHE RELEASES HER 33,000 
[000:33:43;15] E-MAILS THAT HAVE BEEN DELETED,
[000:33:45;18] AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I
[000:33:48;16] WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE 
[000:33:50;20] MY TAX RETURNS.
[000:33:51;21] AND THAT'S AGAINST MY 
[000:33:52;17] LAWYERS -- THEY SAY, DON'T DO 
[000:33:54;17] IT.
[000:33:54;27] I WILL TELL YOU THIS -- NO IN 
[000:33:57;17] FACT, WATCHING SHOWS AND 
[000:33:58;18] READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST 
[000:34:00;19] EVERY LAWYER SAYS, YOU DON'T 
[000:34:02;17] RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE 
[000:34:03;19] AUDIT IS COMPLETE.
[000:34:04;21] WHEN THE AUDIT IS COMPLETE, 
[000:34:05;21] I'LL DO IT.
[000:34:06;16] BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF 
[000:34:07;21] SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS. 
[000:34:10;22] LESTER HOLT:  SO IT'S 
[000:34:11;11] NEGOTIABLE? 
[000:34:11;25] DONALD TRUMP: IT'S NOT 
[000:34:12;15] NEGOTIABLE, NO.
[000:34:13;02] LET HER RELEASE THE E-MAILS.
[000:34:14;23] WHY DID SHE DELETE 13,000. 
[000:34:16;28] LESTER HOLT:  I'LL LET HER 
[000:34:17;25] ANSWER THAT BUT I WANT TO 
[000:34:20;23] ADMONISH THE AUDIENCE, WE 
[000:34:23;00] AGREED ON SILENCE.
[000:34:23;27] SECRETARY CLINTON. 
[000:34:25;00] HILLARY CLINTON: I THINK YOU'VE
[000:34:25;25] SEEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BAIT 
[000:34:27;01] AND SWITCH HERE.
[000:34:27;28] FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING 
[000:34:29;09] FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED 
[000:34:31;03] THEIR TAX RETURNS.
[000:34:32;01] YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY I 
[000:34:35;01] THINK 39, 40 YEARS OF OUR TAX 
[000:34:37;02] RETURNS.
[000:34:37;14] BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT.
[000:34:38;05] WE KNOW THE I.R.S. HAS MADE 
[000:34:40;05] CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION 
[000:34:41;13] ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE 
[000:34:43;10] UNDER AUDIT.
[000:34:44;02] SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF 
[000:34:46;13] WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX 
[000:34:49;09] RETURNS? 
[000:34:49;22] AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A 
[000:34:50;14] COUPLE OF REASONS.
[000:34:52;12] FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH 
[000:34:56;13] AS HE SAYS HE IS.
[000:34:58;06] SECRETARY, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS 
[000:34:59;11] CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE.
[000:35:01;07] THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS
[000:35:02;14] BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE 
[000:35:04;13] BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE
[000:35:07;08] REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT 
[000:35:09;09] $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND
[000:35:12;10] FOREIGN BANKS.
[000:35:14;09] OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE 
[000:35:15;13] AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU 
[000:35:16;21] WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT 
[000:35:18;10] HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL 
[000:35:20;11] TAXES, BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS 
[000:35:21;19] THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A
[000:35:23;19] COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO 
[000:35:26;20] TURN THEM OVER TO STATE 
[000:35:27;19] AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING 
[000:35:28;19] TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND 
[000:35:30;18] THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY 
[000:35:32;20] FEDERAL INCOME TAX. 
[000:35:33;24] DONALD TRUMP: THAT MAKES ME 
[000:35:35;17] SMART. 
[000:35:35;29] HILLARY CLINTON: SO HE PAID 
[000:35:36;23] ZERO THAT MEANS ZERO FOR 
[000:35:38;20] TROOPS ZERO FOR VETS, ZERO FOR
[000:35:41;23] SCHOOLS OR HEALTH, AND I THINK 
[000:35:44;25] PROBABLY HE'S NOT ALL THAT 
[000:35:46;24] ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HAVING THE 
[000:35:48;01] REST OF OUR COUNTRY SEE WHAT 
[000:35:50;27] THE REAL REASONS ARE, BECAUSE 
[000:35:52;24] IT MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY 
[000:35:54;26] IMPORTANT, EVEN TERRIBLE THAT 
[000:35:55;29] HE'S TRYING TO HIDE, AND THE 
[000:35:57;01] FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT,
[000:35:59;29] THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE TAX 
[000:36:01;02] RATE.
[000:36:01;13] THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ALL THE 
[000:36:02;27] DETAILS THAT TAX RETURNS WOULD.
[000:36:04;28] AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT 
[000:36:07;26] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
[000:36:09;01] AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE 
[000:36:10;00] AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE
[000:36:13;00] THAT HE'S EVER GOING TO RELEASE
[000:36:15;02] HIS TAX RETURNS, BECAUSE 
[000:36:17;00] THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S HIDING.
[000:36:19;03] AND WE'LL GUESS.
[000:36:20;05] WE'LL KEEP GUESSING AT WHAT IT 
[000:36:22;03] MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING, BUT 
[000:36:23;08] I THINK THE QUESTION IS, WERE 
[000:36:25;06] HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE WHITE 
[000:36:28;10] HOUSE, WHAT WOULD BE THOSE 
[000:36:30;03] CONFLICTS? 
[000:36:30;17] WHO DOES HE OWE MONEY TO? 
[000:36:33;05] WELL HE OWES YOU THE ANSWERS 
[000:36:35;13] TO THAT, AND HE SHOULD PROVIDE 
[000:36:37;11] THEM. 
[000:36:37;22] LESTER HOLT:  HE ALSO RAISED 
[000:36:38;15] THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS.
[000:36:39;14] DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT?
[000:36:41;07] HILLARY CLINTON: I DO.
[000:36:41;26] YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE 
[000:36:44;09] USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. 
[000:36:46;14] DONALD TRUMP: THAT'S FOR SURE. 
[000:36:47;08] HILLARY CLINTON: AND IF I HAD 
[000:36:48;01] TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD 
[000:36:49;16] OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
[000:36:51;08] BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY 
[000:36:52;17] EXCUSES.
[000:36:53;08] IT WAS A MISTAKE.
[000:36:54;13] AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
[000:36:56;14] THAT.
[000:36:57;08] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP. 
[000:36:58;14] DONALD TRUMP: THAT WAS MORE 
[000:36:59;18] THAN A MISTAKE.
[000:37:01;11] THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY.
[000:37:02;12] OKAY, THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE.
[000:37:03;17] THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY.
[000:37:05;18] WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING
[000:37:09;14] THE FIFTH AMENDMENT -- TAKING 
[000:37:11;17] THE FIFTH SO THEY'RE NOT 
[000:37:13;14] PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE 
[000:37:14;16] MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL 
[000:37:15;22] SERVER TAKING THE FIFTH, I 
[000:37:17;20] THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL.
[000:37:18;22] AND BELIEVE ME, THIS COUNTRY 
[000:37:20;17] THINKS IT'S DISGRACE -- REALLY 
[000:37:22;18] THINKS IT'S DISGRACEFUL ALSO.
[000:37:24;20] AS FAR AS MY TAX RETURNS, YOU 
[000:37:26;27] DON'T LEARN THAT MUCH FROM TAX 
[000:37:28;19] RETURNS.
[000:37:29;01] THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
[000:37:29;22] YOU LEARN A LOT FROM FINANCIAL 
[000:37:31;27] DISCLOSURE, AND YOU SHOULD GO 
[000:37:32;21] DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
[000:37:33;27] THE OTHER THING I'M EXTREMELY 
[000:37:38;21] UNDER-LEVERAGED.
[000:37:39;07] THE REPORT THAT SAID 
[000:37:39;26] 650 -- WHICH BY THE WAY, A LOT 
[000:37:41;03] OF FRIENDS OF MINE THAT KNOW MY
[000:37:42;26] BUSINESS SAID BOY, THAT'S 
[000:37:44;04] REALLY NOT A LOT OF MONEY.
[000:37:46;00] THAT'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF 
[000:37:47;02] MONEY RELATIVE TO WHAT I HAVE.
[000:37:48;03] THE BUILDINGS IN QUESTION, THEY
[000:37:49;26] SAID IN THE SAME 
[000:37:50;13] REPORT -- ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T 
[000:37:52;09] EVEN A BAD STORY TO BE HONEST 
[000:37:53;04] WITH YOU BUT THE BUILDINGS ARE 
[000:37:54;28] WORTH $3.9 BILLION AND THE 650 
[000:37:57;00] ISN'T EVEN OF THAT.
[000:37:58;27] BUT IT'S NOT 650.
[000:37:59;29] IT'S MUCH LESS THAN THAT.
[000:38:01;02] BUT I COULD GIVE YOU A LIST OF 
[000:38:02;27] BANKS, IF THAT WOULD HELP YOU, 
[000:38:05;04] I WOULD GIVE YOU A LIST OF 
[000:38:07;04] BANKS, VERY FINE INSTITUTIONS 
[000:38:09;01] AND FINE BANKS I COULD DO THAT 
[000:38:11;03] QUICKLY.
[000:38:11;15] I AM UNDER LEVERAGED I HAVE A 
[000:38:14;03] GREAT COMPANY AND HAVE A 
[000:38:17;04] TREMENDOUS INCOME.
[000:38:18;07] I'M NOT SAYING THAT IN A 
[000:38:21;04] BRAGODOCIOUS WAY.
[000:38:22;08] IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY 
[000:38:23;16] RUNNING THIS COUNTRY HAS AN 
[000:38:25;09] IDEA ABOUT MONEY.
[000:38:26;07] WHEN WE HAVE $20 TRILLION IN 
[000:38:27;14] DEBT AND OUR COUNTRY IS IN 
[000:38:29;08] DEBT -- IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE 
[000:38:31;12] $20 TRILLION IN DEBT AND OUR 
[000:38:32;13] ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE GOOD, AND
[000:38:34;10] EVERYTHING IS IN GREAT SHAPE, 
[000:38:35;14] OUR AIRPORTS ARE LIKE FROM A 
[000:38:37;11] THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.
[000:38:38;15] YOU LAND AT LAGUARDIA, YOU LAND
[000:38:42;13] AT KENNEDY, LAX, NEW A, AND YOU
[000:38:45;13] COME IN FROM DUBAI  CHINA, YOU
[000:38:49;15] SEE THESE INCREDIBLE AIRPORTS 
[000:38:50;16] AND YOU LAND, WE'VE BECOME A 
[000:38:52;18] THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.
[000:38:53;20] SO THE WORST OF ALL THINGS HAS 
[000:38:55;18] HAPPENED.
[000:38:56;01] WE OWE $20 TRILLION AND WE'RE A
[000:38:59;20] MASS.
[000:39:00;21] WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.
[000:39:02;22] WE'VE SPENT $6 TRILLION IN THE 
[000:39:04;00] MIDDLE EAST ACCORDING TO A 
[000:39:04;29] REPORT THAT I JUST SAW, WHETHER
[000:39:07;00] IT'S 6 OR 5, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
[000:39:09;00] IT'S 6.
[000:39:11;23] $6 TRILLION.
[000:39:13;00] IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE COULD 
[000:39:13;29] HAVE REBUILT OUR COUNTRY TWICE
[000:39:16;05] AND IT'S REALLY A SHAME.
[000:39:17;27] IT'S POLITICIANS LIKE SECRETARY
[000:39:19;25] CLINTON THAT HAVE CAUSED THIS 
[000:39:21;01] PROBLEM.
[000:39:21;25] OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS 
[000:39:23;26] PROBLEMS.
[000:39:24;09] WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION WE'RE A 
[000:39:26;02] SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION, AND WE 
[000:39:27;04] HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW 
[000:39:29;28] ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW 
[000:39:31;07] BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW 
[000:39:32;28] SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS AND WE 
[000:39:34;03] DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE 
[000:39:35;04] IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY
[000:39:37;03] OF YOUR IDEAS. 
[000:39:39;04] HILLARY CLINTON: AND YOU 
[000:39:41;04] HAVEN'T PAID ANY FEDERAL INCOME
[000:39:42;13] TAX FOR A LOT OF YEARS.
[000:39:45;07] [CHEERING] 
[000:39:45;21] HILLARY CLINTON: AND THE OTHER 
[000:39:46;18] THING THAT'S IMPORTANT -- 
[000:39:48;05] DONALD TRUMP: IT WOULD BE 
[000:39:48;26] SQUANDERED TOO, BELIEVE ME. 
[000:39:49;18] HILLARY CLINTON: IF YOUR MAIN 
[000:39:50;11] CLAIM TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE 
[000:39:51;20] UNITED STATES IS YOUR BUSINESS
[000:39:52;14] THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK 
[000:39:55;10] ABOUT THAT.
[000:39:56;07] YOU KNOW, YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER
[000:39:57;16] SAID THAT YOU BUILT A LOT OF 
[000:40:01;15] BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF 
[000:40:02;14] LITTLE GUYS.
[000:40:03;12] AND, INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT 
[000:40:04;22] OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED 
[000:40:07;14] BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, 
[000:40:10;11] DONALD.
[000:40:10;23] I'VE MET DISHWASHERS, PAINTERS,
[000:40:14;12] ARCHITECTS, GLASS INSTALLERS, 
[000:40:16;21] MARBLE INSTALLERS DRAPERY 
[000:40:20;16] INSTALLERS, LIKE MY DAD WAS, 
[000:40:21;23] WHO YOU REFUSED TO PAY WHEN 
[000:40:23;20] THEY FINISHED THE WORK THAT YOU
[000:40:25;17] ASKED THEM TO DO.
[000:40:30;16] WE HAVE AN ARCHITECT IN THE 
[000:40:31;23] AUDIENCE WHO DESIGNED ONE OF 
[000:40:32;17] YOUR CLUBHOUSES AT ONE OF YOUR 
[000:40:34;17] GOLF COURSES.
[000:40:35;17] IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY.
[000:40:36;25] IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE.
[000:40:38;21] AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE 
[000:40:41;29] MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID, WHAT HE 
[000:40:43;29] WAS CHARGING YOU TO DO. 
[000:40:45;03] DONALD TRUMP: MAYBE HE DIDN'T 
[000:40:46;01] DO A GOOD JOB AND I WAS 
[000:40:47;23] UNSATISFIED WITH HIS WORK, 
[000:40:48;26] WHICH OUR COUNTRY SHOULD DO 
[000:40:51;26] TOO. 
[000:40:52;07] HILLARY CLINTON: TO THE 
[000:40:52;27] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT YOU 
[000:40:54;02] HAVE STIFFED OVER THE COURSE OF
[000:40:55;00] YOUR BUSINESS, DO THEY NOT 
[000:40:57;03] DESERVE SOME KIND OF APOLOGY 
[000:40:58;29] FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS TAKEN 
[000:41:01;27] THEIR LABOR, TAKEN THE GOODS 
[000:41:03;29] THAT THEY'VE PRODUCED AND THEN 
[000:41:05;24] REFUSED TO PAY THEM? 
[000:41:07;00] I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I'M 
[000:41:08;01] CERTAINLY RELIEVED THAT MY LATE
[000:41:09;27] FATHER NEVER DID BUSINESS WITH 
[000:41:11;00] YOU.
[000:41:11;10] HE PROVIDED A GOOD MIDDLE CLASS
[000:41:13;05] LIFE FOR US, BUT THE PEOPLE HE 
[000:41:15;06] WORKED FOR, HE EXPECTED THE 
[000:41:17;04] BARGAIN TO BE KEPT ON BOTH 
[000:41:19;05] SIDES.
[000:41:22;03] AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR 
[000:41:24;05] BUSINESS, YOU'VE TAKEN BUSINESS
[000:41:27;06] BANKRUPTCY SIX TIMES.
[000:41:28;09] THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT 
[000:41:29;00] BUSINESS PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER
[000:41:31;14] TAKEN BANKRUPTCY ONCE.
[000:41:32;09] YOU CALL YOURSELF THE KING OF 
[000:41:34;06] DEBT.
[000:41:34;17] YOU TALK ABOUT LEVERAGE.
[000:41:36;07] YOU EVEN AT ONE TIME SUGGESTED 
[000:41:39;08] THAT YOU WOULD TRY TO NEGOTIATE
[000:41:41;16] DOWN THE -- 
[000:41:43;12] DONALD TRUMP: WRONG. 
[000:41:44;13] HILLARY CLINTON: -- NATIONAL 
[000:41:45;11] DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[000:41:46;23] WELL SOMETIMES THERE'S NOT A 
[000:41:48;12] DIRECT TRANSFER OF SKILLS FROM 
[000:41:50;11] BUSINESS TO GOVERNMENT.
[000:41:52;11] BUT SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENED IN 
[000:41:54;13] BUSINESS WOULD BE REALLY BAD 
[000:41:56;17] FOR GOVERNMENT.
[000:41:57;19] AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR 
[000:41:59;14] ABOUT THAT. 
[000:41:59;28] DONALD TRUMP: LOOK.
[000:42:00;17] IT'S ALL WORDS.
[000:42:01;21] IT'S ALL SOUND BYTES.
[000:42:03;19] I'VE BUILT AN UNBELIEVABLE 
[000:42:06;19] COMPANY.
[000:42:07;01] SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS 
[000:42:07;23] ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, REAL 
[000:42:08;23] ESTATE ASSETS ANYWHERE IN THE 
[000:42:10;22] WORLD BEYOND THE UNITED STATES
[000:42:11;24] EUROPE, LOTS OF DIFFERENT 
[000:42:13;21] PLACES.
[000:42:14;03] IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE COMPANY.
[000:42:16;02] BUT ON OCCASION, FOUR TIMES, WE
[000:42:18;26] USED CERTAIN LAWS THAT ARE 
[000:42:22;20] THERE.
[000:42:23;01] AND WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON 
[000:42:24;26] TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T 
[000:42:26;28] GET PAID FIRST OF ALL, THEY 
[000:42:28;02] DID GET PAID A LOT, BUT TAKING 
[000:42:33;26] ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE 
[000:42:35;27] NATION.
[000:42:36;09] IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS,
[000:42:37;03] YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, 
[000:42:38;02] CHANGE THE LAWS.
[000:42:39;02] BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
[000:42:41;01] LAWS OF THE NATION, BECAUSE I'M
[000:42:41;29] RUNNING THE COMPANY.
[000:42:43;01] MY OBLIGATION RIGHT NOW IS TO 
[000:42:44;01] DO WELL FOR MYSELF, MY FAMILY 
[000:42:46;02] MY EMPLOYEES FOR MY COMPANIES 
[000:42:47;07] AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.
[000:42:48;29] BUT WHAT SHE DOESN'T SAY IS 
[000:42:51;03] THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
[000:42:51;24] PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLY 
[000:42:56;05] HAPPY AND THAT LOVE ME.
[000:42:57;01] I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
[000:42:58;07] WE'RE JUST OPENING UP ON 
[000:43:00;04] PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT NEXT 
[000:43:02;04] TO THE WHITE HOUSE, SO IF I 
[000:43:03;04] DON'T GET THERE ONE WAY, I'M 
[000:43:05;05] GOING TO GET TO PENNSYLVANIA 
[000:43:07;06] AVENUE ANOTHER.
[000:43:08;09] BUT WE'RE OPENING THE OLD POST 
[000:43:11;06] OFFICE.
[000:43:11;18] UNDER BUDGET, AHEAD OF 
[000:43:14;07] SCHEDULE SAVE TREMENDOUS 
[000:43:15;16] MONEY.
[000:43:16;07] I'M A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.
[000:43:17;13] AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY 
[000:43:19;12] SHOULD BE DOING.
[000:43:21;10] WE BUILD ROADS AND BECAUSE TWO 
[000:43:22;18] OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES WHAT 
[000:43:24;12] THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COST, WE 
[000:43:25;16] BUY PRODUCTS FOR OUR MILITARY 
[000:43:27;17] AND THEY COME AT COSTS THAT ARE
[000:43:28;20] SO FAR ABOVE WHAT THEY WERE 
[000:43:29;25] SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE WE DON'T
[000:43:30;24] HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT 
[000:43:31;23] THEY'RE DOING.
[000:43:32;16] WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET, THE
[000:43:35;14] BUDGET IS BAD TO A LARGE EXTENT
[000:43:37;18] BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT 
[000:43:38;18] HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHAT TO DO 
[000:43:40;20] AND HOW TO BUY.
[000:43:43;17] THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL IS WAY 
[000:43:45;20] UNDER BUDGET AND WAY AHEAD OF 
[000:43:47;19] SCHEDULE, AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE
[000:43:48;25] TO DO THAT FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
[000:43:50;23] LESTER HOLT:  WELL, WE'RE WELL 
[000:43:51;23] BEHIND SCHEDULE SO I WANT TO 
[000:43:52;25] MOVE TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT.
[000:43:54;23] WE MOVE INTO OUR NEXT SEGMENT 
[000:43:56;26] TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S 
[000:43:57;20] DIRECTION AND LET'S START 
[000:43:58;24] TALKING ABOUT RACE.
[000:43:59;20] THE SHARE OF AMERICANS WHO SAY 
[000:44:01;01] RACE RELATIONS ARE BAD IN THIS 
[000:44:02;25] COUNTRY IS THE HIGHEST IT'S 
[000:44:03;29] BEEN IN DECADES.
[000:44:04;27] MUCH OF IT AMPLIFIED BY 
[000:44:06;26] SHOOTINGS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
[000:44:08;05] BY POLICE, AS WE'VE SEEN 
[000:44:10;00] RECENTLY IN CHARLOTTE AND 
[000:44:11;28] TULSA.
[000:44:12;09] RACE HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE IN 
[000:44:13;07] THIS CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF YOU IS
[000:44:15;04] GOING TO HAVE TO BRIDGE A VERY 
[000:44:16;05] WIDE AND BITTER GAP.
[000:44:17;07] SO HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? 
[000:44:19;05] SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU GET TWO 
[000:44:20;07] MINUTES ON THIS. 
[000:44:22;04] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, YOU'RE 
[000:44:24;02] RIGHT.
[000:44:25;02] RACE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT 
[000:44:28;09] CHALLENGE IN OUR COUNTRY.
[000:44:33;03] UNFORTUNATELY, RACE STILL 
[000:44:34;04] DETERMINES TOO MUCH, OFTEN 
[000:44:35;04] DETERMINES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, 
[000:44:37;05] DETERMINES WHAT KIND OF 
[000:44:39;12] EDUCATION IN THEIR PUBLIC 
[000:44:40;14] SCHOOLS THEY CAN GET AND, YES, 
[000:44:42;11] IT DETERMINES HOW THEY'RE 
[000:44:43;12] TREATED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
[000:44:44;16] SYSTEM.
[000:44:45;07] WE'VE JUST SEEN THOSE TWO 
[000:44:46;15] TRAGIC EXAMPLES IN BOTH TULSA 
[000:44:49;09] AND CHARLOTTE.
[000:44:49;24] AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SEVERAL 
[000:44:53;12] THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.
[000:44:58;12] WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST 
[000:44:59;17] BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND THE 
[000:45:01;22] POLICE.
[000:45:02;04] WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE 
[000:45:05;17] THAT OUR POLICE ARE USING THE 
[000:45:07;23] BEST TRAINING, THE BEST 
[000:45:08;23] TECHNIQUES THAT THEY'RE WELL 
[000:45:11;23] PREPARED TO USE FORCE ONLY WHEN
[000:45:16;21] NECESSARY.
[000:45:17;04] EVERYONE SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY
[000:45:19;23] THE LAW, AND EVERYONE SHOULD 
[000:45:22;25] RESPECT THE LAW.
[000:45:23;26] RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT THE CASE 
[000:45:25;27] IN A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.
[000:45:28;25] SO I HAVE -- EVER SINCE THE 
[000:45:30;01] FIRST DAY OF MY 
[000:45:30;27] CAMPAIGN -- CALLED FOR CRIMINAL
[000:45:32;08] JUSTICE REFORM.
[000:45:33;00] I'VE LAID OUT A PLATFORM THAT I
[000:45:36;02] THINK WOULD BEGIN TO REMEDY 
[000:45:39;00] SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE 
[000:45:40;02] IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
[000:45:41;29] BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE 
[000:45:44;29] IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES 
[000:45:45;22] THAT WE FACE WITH POLICING, 
[000:45:47;04] THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD, BRAVE 
[000:45:50;06] POLICE OFFICERS WHO EQUALLY 
[000:45:51;08] WANT REFORM.
[000:45:52;04] SO WE HAVE TO BRING COMMUNITIES
[000:45:55;04] TOGETHER IN ORDER TO BEGIN 
[000:45:56;06] WORKING ON THAT AS A MUTUAL 
[000:45:58;10] GOAL, AND WE'VE GOT TO GET GUNS
[000:46:00;10] OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO 
[000:46:02;12] SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM.
[000:46:04;15] THE GUN EPIDEMIC IS THE LEADING
[000:46:06;13] CAUSE OF DEATH OF YOUNG 
[000:46:08;19] AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, MORE THAN
[000:46:10;15] THE NEXT NINE CAUSES PUT 
[000:46:12;17] TOGETHER.
[000:46:13;00] SO WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS, AS
[000:46:14;24] I SAID: WE HAVE TO RESTORE 
[000:46:17;20] TRUST, WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE
[000:46:18;20] POLICE, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE 
[000:46:20;20] THEY RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES 
[000:46:21;28] AND THE COMMUNITIES RESPECT 
[000:46:22;24] THEM, AND WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE
[000:46:24;21] PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH 
[000:46:25;25] IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT 
[000:46:27;00] OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE 
[000:46:27;28] SEEING TODAY. 
[000:46:28;26] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, YOU 
[000:46:29;26] HAVE TWO MINUTES.
[000:46:30;23] HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? 
[000:46:33;02] DONALD TRUMP: FIRST OF ALL, 
[000:46:34;29] SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT 
[000:46:36;01] TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS, AND 
[000:46:37;29] THAT'S "LAW" AND "ORDER."  
[000:46:41;05] WE NEED LAW AND ORDER.
[000:46:42;05] IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, WE'RE NOT 
[000:46:43;07] GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND 
[000:46:44;07] WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 
[000:46:46;09] IN CHARLOTTE A CITY I LOVE, A 
[000:46:51;06] CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, 
[000:46:52;05] WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 
[000:46:53;09] THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR
[000:46:55;05] COUNTRY -- I CAN KEEP NAMING 
[000:46:56;15] THEM ALL DAY LONG.
[000:46:58;07] WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN OUR 
[000:46:59;10] COUNTRY.
[000:46:59;22] AND I JUST GOT TODAY THE -- AS 
[000:47:01;23] YOU KNOW, THE ENDORSEMENT OF 
[000:47:03;17] THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE.
[000:47:08;17] WHICH JUST CAME IN.
[000:47:10;12] WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FROM I 
[000:47:11;25] THINK ALMOST EVERY POLICE 
[000:47:12;21] GROUP, VERY -- A LARGE 
[000:47:14;15] PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE 
[000:47:16;17] UNITED STATES.
[000:47:17;02] WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE 
[000:47:19;18] HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, 
[000:47:22;22] AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, 
[000:47:24;24] ARE LIVING IN HELL BECAUSE IT'S
[000:47:26;29] SO DANGEROUS.
[000:47:27;25] YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET, YOU 
[000:47:29;29] GET SHOT.
[000:47:31;24] IN CHICAGO THEY'VE HAD 
[000:47:36;01] THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS, 
[000:47:38;27] THOUSANDS, SINCE JANUARY 1ST.
[000:47:41;03] THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS.
[000:47:42;28] I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? 
[000:47:45;03] IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY? 
[000:47:46;11] WHAT ARE WE DOING? 
[000:47:47;03] AND WE HAVE TO STOP THE 
[000:47:49;01] VIOLENCE.
[000:47:49;14] WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND 
[000:47:50;08] ORDER.
[000:47:50;19] IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO WHERE 
[000:47:52;04] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
[000:47:53;03] KILLED.
[000:47:53;15] THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST NUMBER 
[000:47:55;07] OF YEARS.
[000:47:56;09] IN FACT, ALMOST 4,000 HAVE BEEN
[000:47:58;09] KILLED SINCE BARACK OBAMA 
[000:48:00;06] BECAME PRESIDENT.
[000:48:02;06] OVER FOUR -- ALMOST 4,000 
[000:48:04;10] PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN 
[000:48:05;09] KILLED.
[000:48:05;21] WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND 
[000:48:07;09] ORDER.
[000:48:07;20] NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE 
[000:48:08;15] LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND 
[000:48:10;14] FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL.
[000:48:12;13] MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE.
[000:48:14;15] IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW 
[000:48:15;16] YORK.
[000:48:15;27] IT BROUGHT THE CRIME RATE WAY 
[000:48:17;15] DOWN.
[000:48:17;26] BUT YOU TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM 
[000:48:19;20] CRIMINALS THAT SHOULDN'T BE 
[000:48:20;22] HAVING IT.
[000:48:21;19] WE HAVE TO GANGS ROAMING THE 
[000:48:22;23] STREETS.
[000:48:23;16] AND IN MANY CASES, THEY'RE 
[000:48:24;24] ILLEGALLY HERE.
[000:48:25;19] THEY'RE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
[000:48:27;16] AND THEY HAVE GUNS AND THEY 
[000:48:28;19] SHOOT PEOPLE.
[000:48:29;04] AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG.
[000:48:30;21] AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY 
[000:48:32;19] VIGILANT.
[000:48:33;02] WE HAVE TO BE -- WE HAVE TO 
[000:48:34;18] KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.
[000:48:35;18] RIGHT NOW, OUR POLICE, IN MANY 
[000:48:38;18] CASES, ARE AFRAID TO DO 
[000:48:40;21] ANYTHING.
[000:48:41;04] WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR INNER 
[000:48:42;21] CITIES BECAUSE 
[000:48:43;26] AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES 
[000:48:45;22] ARE BEING DECIMATED BY CRIME.
[000:48:49;00] YOUR TWO MINUTES HAVE EXPIRED 
[000:48:50;04] BUT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP.
[000:48:51;28] STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED 
[000:48:53;28] UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK 
[000:48:54;21] BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT 
[000:48:57;01] BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. 
[000:48:59;07] DONALD TRUMP: NO YOU'RE WRONG.
[000:49:01;07] IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE, WHO WAS
[000:49:04;07] A VERY AGAINST POLICE JOB.
[000:49:09;08] IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER, AND
[000:49:10;12] OUR MAYOR, OUR NEW MAYOR 
[000:49:12;10] REFUSED TO GO FORWARD WITH THE 
[000:49:13;17] CASE.
[000:49:13;28] THEY WOULD HAVE WON ON APPEAL.
[000:49:15;14] IF YOU LOOKED AT IT THROUGHOUT 
[000:49:16;21] THE COUNTRY THERE ARE MANY 
[000:49:19;12] PLACES. 
[000:49:19;24] LESTER HOLT:  THE ARGUMENT IS 
[000:49:21;15] IT'S A FORM OF RACIAL PROFILE. 
[000:49:23;16] DONALD TRUMP: NO THE ARGUMENT 
[000:49:24;19] IS WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GUNS 
[000:49:26;16] AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE BAD 
[000:49:27;16] PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE 
[000:49:29;13] THEM.
[000:49:29;24] THESE ARE FELONS AND THESE ARE 
[000:49:30;24] BAD PEOPLE -- WHEN YOU HAVE 
[000:49:32;15] 3,000 SHOOTINGS IN CHICAGO FROM
[000:49:34;21] JANUARY 1ST, WHEN YOU HAVE 
[000:49:37;15] 4,000 PEOPLE KILLED IN CHICAGO 
[000:49:40;17] BY GUNS FROM THE BEGINNING OF 
[000:49:42;00] THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA,
[000:49:43;24] HIS HOME TOWN YOU HAVE TO HAVE
[000:49:47;02] STOP AND FRISK.
[000:49:47;25] YOU NEED MORE POLICE.
[000:49:49;24] YOU NEED A BETTER COMMUNITY, 
[000:49:52;28] YOU KNOW RELATION.
[000:49:54;23] YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD COMMUNITY 
[000:49:55;16] RELATIONS IN CHICAGO.
[000:49:57;25] IT'S TERRIBLE.
[000:49:58;10] I HAVE PROPERTY THERE.
[000:49:59;02] IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT'S GOING ON 
[000:50:00;08] IN CHICAGO.
[000:50:01;00] BUT WHEN YOU LOOK -- AND 
[000:50:02;04] CHICAGO IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
[000:50:04;26] YOU GO TO FERGUSON.
[000:50:05;26] YOU GO TO SO MANY DIFFERENT 
[000:50:06;27] PLACES.
[000:50:07;09] YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS.
[000:50:08;06] I AGREE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON 
[000:50:09;27] ON THIS.
[000:50:10;09] YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS 
[000:50:11;13] BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE
[000:50:12;08] POLICE BECAUSE IN SOME CASES 
[000:50:13;29] IT'S NOT GOOD.
[000:50:14;14] BUT YOU LOOK AT DALLAS WHERE 
[000:50:16;04] THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY 
[000:50:18;00] STUDIED.
[000:50:18;12] THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY A
[000:50:21;07] BEAUTIFUL THING.
[000:50:23;01] AND THEN FIVE POLICE OFFICERS 
[000:50:25;03] WERE KILLED.
[000:50:26;09] ONE NIGHT VERY VIOLENTLY.
[000:50:29;09] SO THERE'S SOME BAD THINGS 
[000:50:30;09] GOING ON SOME REALLY BAD 
[000:50:32;04] THINGS.
[000:50:32;16] BUT WE NEED -- LESTER, WE NEED 
[000:50:34;12] LAW AND ORDER AND WE NEED LAW 
[000:50:36;09] AND ORDER IN THE INNER CITIES 
[000:50:38;05] BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
[000:50:39;13] MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S 
[000:50:42;12] HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
[000:50:43;06] AND HISPANIC PEOPLE AND IT'S 
[000:50:45;11] VERY UNFAIR TO THEM WHAT OUR 
[000:50:47;12] POLITICIANS ARE ALLOWING TO 
[000:50:50;09] HAPPEN. 
[000:50:50;21] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[000:50:51;14] CLINTON. 
[000:50:51;27] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, I'VE 
[000:50:53;13] HEARD DONALD SAY THIS AT HIS 
[000:50:59;13] RALLIES, AND IT'S REALLY 
[000:51:06;12] UNFORTUNATE THAT HE'D PAINT 
[000:51:07;20] SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF
[000:51:08;14] BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR 
[000:51:09;05] COUNTRY.
[000:51:09;17] YOU KNOW, THE VIBRANCY OF THE 
[000:51:10;11] BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK 
[000:51:12;18] BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY 
[000:51:14;17] PEOPLE, THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT 
[000:51:15;26] SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO
[000:51:17;22] PROVIDE FOR THEIR KIDS THERE'S
[000:51:21;24] A LOT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD 
[000:51:23;20] OF AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING 
[000:51:24;26] AND LIFTING UP.
[000:51:27;21] BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE 
[000:51:29;21] SURE THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.
[000:51:30;28] THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF 
[000:51:32;03] DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE 
[000:51:39;06] WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE.
[000:51:39;27] STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE 
[000:51:40;21] UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
[000:51:41;08] AND, IN PART, BECAUSE IT WAS 
[000:51:42;01] INEFFECTIVE. AND THEN THERE ARE 
[000:51:42;25] WAYS
[000:51:43;05] IT DID NOT DO WHAT IT NEEDED TO
[000:51:44;27] DO.
[000:51:45;25] NOW, I BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY 
[000:51:46;28] POLICING.
[000:51:47;26] AND, IN FACT VIOLENT CRIME IS 
[000:51:49;04] ONE HALF OF WHAT IT WAS IN 
[000:51:51;28] 1991.
[000:51:52;28] PROPERTY CRIME IS DOWN 40%.
[000:51:55;28] WE JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE IT 
[000:51:58;01] CREEP BACK UP.
[000:51:59;04] WE'VE HAD 25 YEARS OF VERY GOOD
[000:52:04;06] COOPERATION, BUT THERE WERE 
[000:52:05;15] SOME PROBLEMS, SOME UNINTENDED 
[000:52:09;11] CONSEQUENCES.
[000:52:09;26] TOO MANY YOUNG 
[000:52:10;17] AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINO 
[000:52:11;16] MEN ENDED UP IN JAIL FOR 
[000:52:15;12] NON-VIOLENT OFFENSES AND IT'S 
[000:52:16;19] JUST A FACT THAT IF YOU'RE A 
[000:52:19;15] YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN AND 
[000:52:20;17] YOU DO THE SAME THING AS A 
[000:52:21;19] YOUNG WHITE MAN, YOU ARE MORE 
[000:52:23;15] LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED, CHARGED,
[000:52:26;15] CONVICTED, AND INCARCERATED.
[000:52:29;22] SO WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE 
[000:52:31;21] SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR CRIMINAL
[000:52:34;26] JUSTICE SYSTEM.
[000:52:35;19] WE CANNOT JUST SAY "LAW AND 
[000:52:37;22] ORDER."  
[000:52:38;23] WE HAVE TO SAY -- WE HAVE TO 
[000:52:40;00] COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN THAT 
[000:52:42;25] IS GOING TO DIVERT PEOPLE FROM 
[000:52:45;01] THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, 
[000:52:48;10] DEAL WITH MANDATORY MINIMUM 
[000:52:50;01] SENTENCES WHICH HAVE PUT TOO 
[000:52:51;03] MANY PEOPLE AWAY FOR TOO LONG 
[000:52:53;01] FOR DOING TOO LITTLE.
[000:52:54;26] WE NEED TO HAVE MORE 
[000:52:56;00] SECOND-CHANCE PROGRAMS.
[000:52:57;02] I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ENDING 
[000:52:59;01] PRIVATE PRISONS IN THE FEDERAL 
[000:53:00;10] SYSTEM.
[000:53:00;28] I WANT TO SEE THEM ENDED IN THE
[000:53:02;05] STATE SYSTEM.
[000:53:02;28] YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROFIT 
[000:53:03;29] MOTIVATION TO FILL PRISON CELLS
[000:53:05;29] WITH YOUNG AMERICANS.
[000:53:08;01] SO THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE WAYS
[000:53:10;01] WE CAN WORK ON THIS, AND I 
[000:53:13;03] BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT COMMON 
[000:53:16;07] SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES WOULD
[000:53:18;05] ASSIST US.
[000:53:19;02] RIGHT NOW -- AND THIS IS 
[000:53:20;08] SOMETHING DONALD HAS SUPPORTED
[000:53:22;08] ALONG WITH THE GUN 
[000:53:24;03] LOBBY -- RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT 
[000:53:26;10] TOO MANY MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS
[000:53:29;02] ON THE STREETS.
[000:53:30;05] IN A LOT OF PLACES, OUR POLICE 
[000:53:33;05] ARE OUT-GUNNED.
[000:53:34;11] WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE 
[000:53:35;13] BACKGROUND CHECKS, AND WE NEED 
[000:53:36;14] TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS 
[000:53:38;15] OF THOSE WHO WILL DO HARM, AND 
[000:53:40;13] WE FINALLY NEED TO PASS A 
[000:53:42;13] PROHIBITION ON ANYONE WHO'S ON 
[000:53:44;13] THE TERRORIST WATCH LIST FROM 
[000:53:45;22] BEING ABLE TO BUY A GUN IN OUR 
[000:53:47;12] COUNTRY.
[000:53:48;08] IF YOU'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY,
[000:53:49;13] YOU ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BUY A 
[000:53:51;13] GUN.
[000:53:51;23] SO THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO, 
[000:53:53;10] AND WE OUGHT TO DO IT IN A 
[000:53:55;09] BIPARTISAN WAY. 
[000:53:55;25] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[000:53:56;18] CLINTON, LAST WEEK, YOU SAID 
[000:53:57;17] WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING 
[000:53:58;18] POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE POLICING TO
[000:54:00;11] GO RIGHT AT IMPLICIT BIAS.
[000:54:02;13] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE 
[000:54:04;10] IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK
[000:54:06;10] PEOPLE? 
[000:54:06;22] HILLARY CLINTON: LESTER, I 
[000:54:07;16] THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A 
[000:54:09;13] PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST 
[000:54:11;15] POLICE.
[000:54:11;27] I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MANY
[000:54:12;24] OF US IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY JUMP
[000:54:18;18] TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT EACH 
[000:54:20;15] OTHER.
[000:54:20;26] AND, THEREFORE, I THINK WE NEED
[000:54:22;18] ALL OF US TO BE ASKING HARD 
[000:54:24;16] QUESTIONS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHY 
[000:54:26;19] AM I FEELING THIS WAY? 
[000:54:27;18] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLICING 
[000:54:29;16] SINCE IT CAN HAVE LITERALLY, 
[000:54:32;25] FATAL CONSEQUENCES, I HAVE SAID
[000:54:34;21] IN MY FIRST BUDGET, WE WOULD 
[000:54:35;28] PUT MONEY INTO THAT BUDGET TO 
[000:54:38;28] HELP US DEAL WITH IMPLICIT BIAS
[000:54:42;02] BY RETRAINING A LOT OF OUR 
[000:54:43;25] POLICE OFFICERS.
[000:54:44;11] I'VE MET WITH A GROUP OF VERY 
[000:54:46;28] DISTINGUISHED, EXPERIENCED 
[000:54:47;21] POLICE CHIEFS A FEW WEEKS AGO.
[000:54:48;28] THEY ADMIT IT'S AN ISSUE.
[000:54:50;29] THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF CONCERNS.
[000:54:52;08] MENTAL HEALTH IS ONE OF THE 
[000:54:53;04] BIGGEST CONCERNS, BECAUSE NOW 
[000:54:56;00] POLICE ARE HAVING TO HANDLE A 
[000:54:58;01] LOT OF REALLY DIFFICULT MENTAL 
[000:54:59;06] HEALTH PROBLEMS ON THE STREET.
[000:55:00;28] THEY WANT SUPPORT.
[000:55:01;28] THEY WANT MORE TRAINING.
[000:55:03;05] THEY WANT MORE ASSISTANCE.
[000:55:04;29] AND I THINK THE FEDERAL 
[000:55:06;04] GOVERNMENT COULD BE IN A 
[000:55:07;03] POSITION WHERE WE WOULD OFFER 
[000:55:08;13] AND PROVIDE THAT.
[000:55:11;03] DONALD TRUMP: I'D LIKE TO 
[000:55:12;05] RESPOND.
[000:55:13;04] FIRST OF ALL I AGREE, AND A 
[000:55:15;07] LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN WITHIN MY 
[000:55:16;13] OWN PARTY WANT TO GIVE CERTAIN 
[000:55:18;07] RIGHTS TO PEOPLE ON WATCH LISTS
[000:55:19;09] AND NO-FLY LISTS.
[000:55:21;12] I AGREE WITH YOU.
[000:55:22;09] WHEN A PERSON IS ON A WATCH 
[000:55:23;14] LIST OR A NO-FLY LIST AND I 
[000:55:26;15] HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE 
[000:55:29;09] N.R.A., WHICH I'M VERY PROUD 
[000:55:30;10] OF.
[000:55:30;20] THESE ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND 
[000:55:31;17] THEY ARE PROTECTING THE SECOND 
[000:55:33;09] AMENDMENT, BUT I THINK WE HAVE 
[000:55:34;03] TO LOOK VERY STRONGLY AT NO-FLY
[000:55:35;13] LISTS AND WATCH LISTS AND WHEN 
[000:55:37;10] PEOPLE ARE ON THERE, EVEN IF 
[000:55:38;14] THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THERE, 
[000:55:39;15] WE'LL HELP THEM, WE'LL HELP 
[000:55:41;14] THEM LEGALLY GET OFF, BUT I 
[000:55:42;16] TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT, QUITE 
[000:55:45;13] STRONGLY.
[000:55:45;26] I DO WANT TO BRING UP THE FACT 
[000:55:47;13] THAT YOU WERE THE ONE THAT 
[000:55:48;05] BROUGHT UP THE WORD "SUPER 
[000:55:51;18] PREDATOR" ABOUT YOUNG, BLACK 
[000:55:52;23] YOUTH AND THAT'S A TERM THAT I 
[000:55:54;20] THINK WAS A TERM THAT'S BEEN 
[000:55:56;22] HORRIBLY MET AS YOU KNOW AND 
[000:55:58;22] I THINK YOU'VE APOLOGIZED FOR 
[000:55:59;22] IT, BUT I THINK IT WAS A 
[000:56:00;24] TERRIBLE THING TO SAY.
[000:56:01;26] AND WHEN IT COMES TO STOP AND 
[000:56:05;23] FRISK, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
[000:56:06;15] TAKING GUNS AWAY.
[000:56:07;23] I'M TALKING ABOUT TAKING GUNS 
[000:56:08;25] AWAY FROM GANGS AND PEOPLE THAT
[000:56:10;01] USE THEM AND I DON'T THINK -- I
[000:56:11;25] REALLY DON'T THINK YOU DISAGREE
[000:56:12;29] WITH ME ON THIS, IF YOU WANT TO
[000:56:14;04] KNOW THE TRUTH.
[000:56:15;00] I THINK MAYBE THERE'S A 
[000:56:22;07] POLITICAL REASON WHY YOU CAN'T 
[000:56:23;01] SAY IT, BUT I REALLY DON'T 
[000:56:23;23] BELIEVE.
[000:56:24;05] IN NEW YORK CITY, STOP AND 
[000:56:24;27] FRISK -- WE HAD 2200 MURDERS 
[000:56:25;20] AND STOP AND FRISK THERE'S A 
[000:56:26;14] POLITICAL REASON WHY BROUGHT IT 
[000:56:27;11] DOWN TO 500 MURDERS.
[000:56:28;02] 500 MURDERS IS A LOT OF 
[000:56:29;03] MURDERS.
[000:56:30;02] HARD TO BELIEVE 500 IS LIKE 
[000:56:32;04] SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD.
[000:56:33;04] BUT WE WENT FROM 2200 TO 500 
[000:56:36;09] AND IT WAS CONTINUED ON BY 
[000:56:38;08] MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS 
[000:56:40;06] TERMINATED BY THE CURRENT MAYOR
[000:56:42;08] BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A 
[000:56:43;09] TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY
[000:56:44;14] OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS 
[000:56:46;11] BEYOND BELIEF.
[000:56:46;26] SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO 
[000:56:48;08] IMPACT, IT REALLY DID.
[000:56:50;08] IT HAD A REALLY BIG IMPACT. 
[000:56:52;12] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, IT'S 
[000:56:53;04] ALSO FAIR TO SAY IF WE'RE GOING
[000:56:54;16] TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS THAT UNDER
[000:56:56;17] THE CURRENT MAYOR CRIME HAS 
[000:56:58;15] CONTINUED TO DROP, INCLUDING 
[000:57:00;11] MURDERS. 
[000:57:00;24] DONALD TRUMP: YOU'RE WRONG. 
[000:57:01;17] HILLARY CLINTON: NO, I'M NOT. 
[000:57:02;15] DONALD TRUMP: MURDERS ARE UP.
[000:57:03;14] ALL RIGHT, YOU CHECK IT.
[000:57:04;14] HILLARY CLINTON: NEW YORK HAS 
[000:57:05;15] DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB, AND I 
[000:57:06;20] GIVE CREDIT.
[000:57:07;16] I GIVE CREDIT ACROSS THE BOARD 
[000:57:10;14] GOING BACK TWO MAYORS, TWO 
[000:57:15;15] -- TO POLICE CHIEFS AND IT HAS
[000:57:17;16] WORKED BECAUSE OTHER 
[000:57:18;15] COMMUNITIES NEED TO COME 
[000:57:19;19] TOGETHER TO DO WHAT WILL WORK 
[000:57:20;22] AS WELL.
[000:57:21;14] ONE MURDER IS TOO MANY.
[000:57:23;13] BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE 
[000:57:25;16] LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN 
[000:57:28;14] EFFECTIVE AND NOT GO TO THINGS 
[000:57:30;16] THAT SOUND GOOD THAT REALLY DID
[000:57:31;20] NOT HAVE THE KIND OF IMPACT 
[000:57:33;17] THAT WE WOULD WANT.
[000:57:35;20] WHO DISAGREES WITH KEEPING 
[000:57:38;20] NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE? 
[000:57:39;18] BUT LET'S ALSO ADD, NO ONE 
[000:57:41;23] SHOULD DISAGREE ABOUT 
[000:57:43;21] RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF YOUNG 
[000:57:45;28] MEN WHO LIVE IN THOSE 
[000:57:48;22] NEIGHBORHOODS.
[000:57:51;21] AND SO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER 
[000:57:53;28] JOB AGAIN OF WORKING WITH THE 
[000:57:56;28] COMMUNITIES, FACE COMMUNITIES, 
[000:57:59;03] BUSINESS COMMUNITIES, AS WELL 
[000:58:00;07] AS POLICE TO DEAL WITH THIS 
[000:58:02;01] PROBLEM. 
[000:58:02;14] LESTER HOLT:  THIS ISSUE IS 
[000:58:03;06] ABOUT RACE.
[000:58:03;26] SO MR. TRUMP. 
[000:58:05;03] DONALD TRUMP: MAY I RESPOND? 
[000:58:08;04] LESTER HOLT:  PLEASE RESPOND 
[000:58:08;27] AND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP. 
[000:58:11;08] DONALD TRUMP: THE 
[000:58:11;25] AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS 
[000:58:12;19] BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR 
[000:58:13;08] POLITICIANS.
[000:58:14;01] THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION 
[000:58:15;11] TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW AND AFTER 
[000:58:17;04] THE ELECTION, THEY SAID, SEE 
[000:58:18;08] YOU LATER.
[000:58:19;06] I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS.
[000:58:22;03] THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
[000:58:23;06] COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE 
[000:58:24;09] COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER 
[000:58:26;07] CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY 
[000:58:29;04] TREATED, THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED 
[000:58:30;08] AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES 
[000:58:33;05] BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECAUSE
[000:58:35;15] THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
[000:58:36;05] THEY'VE CONTROLLED THESE 
[000:58:36;26] COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO 100 
[000:58:38;06] YEARS. 
[000:58:38;18] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP. 
[000:58:40;10] DONALD TRUMP: IT'S BROKEN.
[000:58:41;08] AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK 
[000:58:43;09] AT THE INNER CITIES, AND I JUST
[000:58:45;08] LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT 
[000:58:46;19] PHILADELPHIA.
[000:58:47;08] YOU'VE SEEN ME.
[000:58:47;24] I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[000:58:49;15] YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME, AND 
[000:58:51;15] THAT'S OKAY.
[000:58:52;08] [LAUGHTER] 
[000:58:52;22] DONALD TRUMP: BUT I WILL TELL 
[000:58:53;16] YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND 
[000:58:55;11] I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST 
[000:58:57;21] PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN 
[000:58:58;15] THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEY ARE 
[000:58:59;22] VERY VERY UPSET WITH WHAT 
[000:59:01;14] THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD 
[000:59:02;21] THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS
[000:59:04;16] HAVE DONE. 
[000:59:06;15] HILLARY CLINTON: I THINK 
[000:59:07;12] THAT -- I THINK DONALD JUST 
[000:59:09;12] CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR
[000:59:10;13] THIS DEBATE.
[000:59:12;17] AND, YES, I DID.
[000:59:13;17] AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I 
[000:59:15;19] PREPARED FOR? 
[000:59:18;14] I'VE PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT, 
[000:59:20;15] AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD 
[000:59:21;22] THING.
[000:59:22;03] [APPLAUSE]. 
[000:59:22;17] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP FOR 
[000:59:23;10] FIVE YEARS YOU'VE PERPETUATED 
[000:59:25;22] A FALSE CLAIM THAT THE 
[000:59:27;18] PRESIDENT'S FIRST BLACK 
[000:59:28;20] PRESIDENT WAS NOT A NATURAL 
[000:59:30;19] BORN CITIZEN.
[000:59:31;04] YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY.
[000:59:32;25] THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU 
[000:59:35;19] ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT MOST 
[000:59:36;24] AMERICANS HAVE ACCEPTED FOR 
[000:59:37;25] YEARS, THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
[000:59:39;00] BORN IN THE UNITED STATES.
[000:59:40;29] DONALD TRUMP: WELL, IT'S VERY 
[000:59:42;02] SIMPLE TO SAY.
[000:59:43;23] SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL  WORKS FOR 
[000:59:46;03] THE CAMPAIGN AND A VERY CLOSE 
[000:59:47;28] FRIEND OF SECRETARY CLINTON, 
[000:59:50;25] AND HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PATTY
[000:59:55;25] DOYLE, WENT TO THE CAMPAIGN, 
[000:59:58;26] HER CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESIDENT 
[001:00:00;24] OBAMA, FOUGHT VERY HARD, AND 
[001:00:02;01] YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP AND YOU 
[001:00:03;02] CAN CHECK IT OUT AND IF YOU 
[001:00:04;02] LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, 
[001:00:08;02] PATTY DOYLE WAS ON WOLF BLITZER
[001:00:11;01] SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED 
[001:00:15;27] BLOOMENTHAL SENT MCCLATHCHY, A 
[001:00:22;08] HIGHLY RESPECTED PRESIDENT, TO 
[001:00:25;05] QUESTION THE PRESIDENT VERY 
[001:00:26;03] HARD ABOUT IT, SHE FAILED TO 
[001:00:27;09] GET THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
[001:00:28;08] WHEN I GOT INVOLVED, I DIDN'T 
[001:00:30;02] FAIL.
[001:00:30;13] I GOT HIM TO GIVE THE BIRTH 
[001:00:32;05] CERTIFICATE SO I'M SATISFIED 
[001:00:33;06] WITH IT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY 
[001:00:34;09] I'M SATISFIED WITH IT, BECAUSE 
[001:00:35;11] I WANT TO GET ON TO DEFEATING 
[001:00:37;06] ISIS, BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ON 
[001:00:38;11] CREATING JOBS, BECAUSE I WANT 
[001:00:39;17] TO GET ON TO HAVING A STRONG 
[001:00:43;08] BORDER, BECAUSE I WANT TO GET 
[001:00:44;09] ON TO THINGS THAT ARE VERY 
[001:00:45;10] IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT ARE 
[001:00:46;17] VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY. 
[001:00:47;17] LESTER HOLT:  I'LL LET YOU 
[001:00:49;08] RESPOND, BUT I JUST WANT TO GET
[001:00:50;09] THE ANSWER HERE.
[001:00:51;14] THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS 
[001:00:52;11] PRODUCED IN 2011.
[001:00:54;11] YOU'VE CONTINUED TO TELL THE 
[001:00:55;14] STORY AND QUESTIONED THE 
[001:00:56;21] PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012
[001:00:59;13] '13, '14, '15, AS RECENTLY AS 
[001:01:01;22] JANUARY.
[001:01:02;04] SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT 
[001:01:03;15] CHANGED YOUR MIND? 
[001:01:04;16] DONALD TRUMP: WELL, NOBODY WAS 
[001:01:05;16] PRESSING IT.
[001:01:06;15] NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT 
[001:01:07;17] IT.
[001:01:07;27] I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE 
[001:01:08;23] QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE, 
[001:01:09;26] BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH 
[001:01:11;19] ABOUT T BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT 
[001:01:12;22] GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH 
[001:01:16;28] CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A
[001:01:18;21] GOOD JOB.
[001:01:19;23] SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT 
[001:01:20;28] IT.
[001:01:21;08] I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOW 
[001:01:23;23] EVERYBODY WILL SAY OH, IT'S NOT
[001:01:25;22] TRUE.
[001:01:26;03] LOOK IT'S TRUE.
[001:01:27;24] SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL SENT THE 
[001:01:29;00] REPORTER.
[001:01:29;25] YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT
[001:01:31;25] CNN, LAST WEEK, THE INTERVIEW 
[001:01:34;03] WITH YOUR FORMER CAMPAIGN 
[001:01:35;07] MANAGER, AND SHE WAS INVOLVED.
[001:01:37;04] BUT JUST LIKE SHE CAN'T BRING 
[001:01:39;04] BACK JOBS, SHE CAN'T PRODUCE. 
[001:01:41;05] LESTER HOLT:  I'M SORRY.
[001:01:42;02] I'M GOING TO FOLLOW UP BUT I 
[001:01:43;01] WILL LET YOU RESPOND TO THAT. 
[001:01:44;06] THERE'S A LOT THERE.
[001:01:45;02] BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL 
[001:01:46;15] HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT.
[001:01:47;06] WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS OF
[001:01:50;09] COLOR. 
[001:01:50;21] DONALD TRUMP: I SAY NOTHING 
[001:01:51;16] BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO GET HIM 
[001:01:53;05] TO PRODUCE IT.
[001:01:54;04] HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IT
[001:01:55;04] A LONG TIME BEFORE.
[001:01:56;03] I SAY NOTHING.
[001:01:57;02] BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WHEN 
[001:01:58;09] YOU TALK ABOUT HEALING I THINK
[001:02:00;08] I'VE DEVELOPED VERY, VERY GOOD 
[001:02:02;07] RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE LAST 
[001:02:04;09] LITTLE WHILE WITH THE 
[001:02:05;16] AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
[001:02:06;16] I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT.
[001:02:08;13] AND I FEEL THAT THEY REALLY 
[001:02:11;13] WANTED ME TO COME TO THAT 
[001:02:13;12] CONCLUSION, AND I THINK I DID A
[001:02:14;13] GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE 
[001:02:16;13] NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT 
[001:02:17;17] EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 
[001:02:19;11] GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS 
[001:02:21;17] BIRTH CERTIFICATE. 
[001:02:22;19] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[001:02:24;12] CLINTON. 
[001:02:24;25] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, JUST 
[001:02:25;17] LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD.
[001:02:27;14] [LAUGHTER] 
[001:02:31;17] HILLARY CLINTON: AND CLEARLY 
[001:02:32;17] AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED HE 
[001:02:34;20] KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE STAND 
[001:02:38;28] <SUFFIX>ING ON
[001:02:40;13] ING ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND 
[001:02:41;25] LESTER JUST ASKED THE QUESTION,
[001:02:42;26] AND HE WOULD PUT THIS WHOLE 
[001:02:45;25] RACIST THING TO BED BUT IT 
[001:02:46;28] CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY.
[001:02:48;29] HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS 
[001:02:51;01] POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON 
[001:02:52;03] THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST 
[001:02:55;01] BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN 
[001:02:57;29] AMERICAN CITIZEN.
[001:02:59;03] THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO 
[001:03:00;06] EVIDENCE FOR IT.
[001:03:01;00] BUT HE PERSISTED.
[001:03:02;07] HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR 
[001:03:05;05] BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS,
[001:03:10;01] PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO 
[001:03:11;08] BRING INTO HIS FOLD APPARENTLY 
[001:03:13;11] BELIEVED IT OR WANTED TO 
[001:03:14;08] BELIEVE IT.
[001:03:16;03] BUT REMEMBER DONALD STARTED 
[001:03:18;08] HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING 
[001:03:22;09] SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
[001:03:25;09] FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, 
[001:03:26;19] BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT RENT 
[001:03:29;10] APARTMENTS IN ONE OF HIS 
[001:03:30;13] DEVELOPMENTS TO 
[001:03:31;12] AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE MADE 
[001:03:33;10] SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED
[001:03:35;10] FOR HIM UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS THE
[001:03:37;20] POLICY.
[001:03:38;02] HE ACTUALLY WAS SUED TWICE BY 
[001:03:39;17] THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
[001:03:42;20] SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF 
[001:03:46;19] ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR.
[001:03:50;17] AND THE BIRTHER LIE WAS A VERY 
[001:03:54;21] HURTFUL ONE.
[001:03:55;20] BARACK OBAMA IS A MAN OF GREAT 
[001:03:57;22] DIGNITY, AND I COULD TELL HOW 
[001:03:58;23] MUCH IT BOTHERED HIM AND 
[001:04:01;24] ANNOYED HIM THAT THIS WAS BEING
[001:04:04;22] TOUTED AND USED AGAINST HIM, 
[001:04:08;00] BUT I'D LIKE TO REMEMBER WHAT 
[001:04:10;01] MICHELLE OBAMA SAID IN HER 
[001:04:10;27] AMAZING SPEECH AT OUR 
[001:04:14;25] DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.
[001:04:16;01] WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH, 
[001:04:18;29] AND BARACK OBAMA WENT HIGH 
[001:04:20;28] DESPITE DONALD TRUMP'S BEST 
[001:04:22;27] EFFORTS TO BRING HIM DOWN. 
[001:04:24;03] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, YOU 
[001:04:25;04] CAN RESPOND AND WE'LL MOVE ON. 
[001:04:27;00] DONALD TRUMP: I'D LOVE TO 
[001:04:27;28] RESPOND.
[001:04:28;10] FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN
[001:04:29;29] PREPARING FOR SOME OF YOUR 
[001:04:33;03] DEBATES AGAINST OBAMA.
[001:04:35;00] YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE 
[001:04:37;01] DISRESPECT.
[001:04:38;02] AND I WATCHED HOW YOU TALK 
[001:04:39;07] ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS 
[001:04:40;03] AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE.
[001:04:42;07] DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
[001:04:44;03] YOU WERE AFTER HIM.
[001:04:45;03] YOU WERE TRYING TO SEND OUT, OR
[001:04:47;05] YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES
[001:04:48;09] OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB, VERY 
[001:04:50;11] FAMOUS PICTURES.
[001:04:51;13] I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY 
[001:04:52;13] THAT.
[001:04:53;06] BUT LAST WEEK, YOUR CAMPAIGN 
[001:04:54;15] MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE.
[001:04:55;14] SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT HOLIER 
[001:04:57;12] THAN THOU, IT REALLY DOESN'T 
[001:04:58;16] WORK.
[001:04:58;27] IT REALLY DOESN'T.
[001:05:01;10] NOW, AS FAR AS THE LAWSUIT, 
[001:05:04;11] YES, WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG, I 
[001:05:06;15] WENT INTO MY FATHER'S COMPANY, 
[001:05:07;17] HE HAD A REAL ESTATE COMPANY IN
[001:05:09;14] BROOKLYN, IN QUEENS, AND WE, 
[001:05:10;22] LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, BY 
[001:05:12;25] THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT WERE SUED
[001:05:18;21] AND WE SETTLED WITHOUT 
[001:05:20;16] ADMISSION OF GUILT.
[001:05:21;22] IT WAS EASY TO DO.   I NOTICE 
[001:05:22;28] YOU BRING THAT UP A LOT AND I 
[001:05:24;22] NOTICE THE NASTY COMMERCIALS 
[001:05:25;26] YOU'RE DOING ON ME IN SO MANY 
[001:05:27;29] DIFFERENT WAYS, WHICH I DON'T 
[001:05:29;25] DO ON YOU, MAYBE I'M TRYING TO 
[001:05:31;04] SAVE THE MONEY.
[001:05:32;00] BUT FRANKLY, I LOOK AT THAT AND
[001:05:33;28] I SAY, ISN'T THAT AMAZING? 
[001:05:35;29] BECAUSE I SETTLED THAT LAWSUIT 
[001:05:38;25] WITH NO ADMISSION OF GUILT.
[001:05:42;02] BUT THAT WAS A LAWSUIT BROUGHT 
[001:05:44;29] AGAINST MANY REAL ESTATE FIRMS.
[001:05:46;01] AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE 
[001:05:47;29] THINGS.
[001:05:48;11] I'LL GO ONE STEP FURTHER.
[001:05:49;05] IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, A 
[001:05:51;10] BRILLIANT COMMUNITY, PROBABLY 
[001:05:52;13] THE WEALTHIEST COMMUNITY THERE 
[001:05:53;16] IS IN THE WORLD I OPENED THE 
[001:05:59;05] CLUB, AND REALLY GOT GREAT 
[001:06:00;13] CREDIT FOR IT.
[001:06:02;03] NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
[001:06:03;08] AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AGAINST 
[001:06:06;05] MUSLIMS, AGAINST ANYBODI, AND 
[001:06:10;12] IT'S A TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL 
[001:06:12;17] CLUB AND I'M SO GLAD I DID IT, 
[001:06:15;07] AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN GREAT 
[001:06:16;20] CREDIT FOR WHAT I DID, AND I'M 
[001:06:18;10] VERY, VERY PROUD OF IT.
[001:06:19;09] AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL.
[001:06:22;06] THAT'S THE TRUE WAY I FEEL. 
[001:06:24;10] LESTER HOLT:  OUR NEXT SEGMENT 
[001:06:26;16] IS CALLED SECURING AMERICA.
[001:06:27;14] WE WANT TO START WITH A 21ST 
[001:06:29;14] CENTURY WAR HAPPENING EVERY DAY
[001:06:30;14] IN THIS COUNTRY.
[001:06:31;12] OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDER 
[001:06:32;19] CYBER ATTACK, AND OUR SECRETS 
[001:06:34;19] ARE BEING STOLEN.
[001:06:35;19] SO MY QUESTION IS, WHO'S BEHIND
[001:06:37;16] IT, AND HOW DO WE FIGHT IT? 
[001:06:38;22] SECRETARY CLINTON, THIS ANSWER 
[001:06:40;20] GOES TO YOU. 
[001:06:41;26] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, I THINK 
[001:06:42;26] CYBER SECURITY, CYBER WARFARE 
[001:06:44;21] WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
[001:06:47;21] CHALLENGES FACING THE NEXT 
[001:06:49;22] PRESIDENT BECAUSE CLEARLY, 
[001:06:50;20] WE'RE FACING AT THIS POINT TWO 
[001:06:51;26] DIFFERENT KINDS OF ADVERSARIES.
[001:06:54;23] THERE ARE THE INDEPENDENT 
[001:06:59;26] HACKING GROUPS THAT DO IT 
[001:07:00;25] MOSTLY FOR COMMERCIAL REASONS 
[001:07:02;01] TO TRY TO STEAL INFORMATION 
[001:07:03;04] THAT THEY THEN CAN USE TO MAKE 
[001:07:04;29] MONEY.
[001:07:05;25] BUT INCREASINGLY, WE ARE SEEING
[001:07:07;28] CYBER ATTACKS COMING FROM 
[001:07:12;25] STATES ORGANS OF STATES.
[001:07:14;29] THE MOST RECENT TROUBLING OF 
[001:07:16;28] THESE HAS BEEN RUSSIA.
[001:07:17;25] THERE'S NO DOUBT NOW THAT 
[001:07:18;29] RUSSIA HAS USED CYBER ATTACKS 
[001:07:24;29] AGAINST ALL KINDS OF 
[001:07:26;03] ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY 
[001:07:27;04] AND I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT
[001:07:28;29] THIS AND I KNOW DONALD IS VERY 
[001:07:31;01] PRAISEWORTHY OF VLADIMIR PUTIN 
[001:07:32;11] BUT PUTIN IS PLAYING A TOUGH 
[001:07:36;10] LONG GAME HERE AND ONE OF THE 
[001:07:38;09] THINGS HE'S DONE IS TO LET 
[001:07:40;07] LOOSE CYBER ATTACKERS TO HACK 
[001:07:42;16] INTO GOVERNMENT FILES TO HACK 
[001:07:45;07] INTO PERSONAL FILES, HACK INTO 
[001:07:46;11] THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL 
[001:07:48;11] COMMITTEE.
[001:07:52;07] AND WE RECENTLY HAVE LEARNED 
[001:07:53;15] THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEIR 
[001:07:54;15] PREFERRED METHODS OF TRYING TO 
[001:07:57;14] WREAK HAVOC AND COLLECT 
[001:07:59;10] INFORMATION.
[001:07:59;24] WE NEED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR, 
[001:08:01;13] WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA, CHINA, 
[001:08:02;15] IRAN OR ANYBODY ELSE, THE 
[001:08:06;15] UNITED STATES HAS MUCH GREATER 
[001:08:09;21] CAPACITY, AND WE ARE NOT GOING 
[001:08:10;25] TO SIT IDLY BY AND PERMIT STATE
[001:08:15;26] ACTORS TO GO AFTER OUR 
[001:08:17;20] INFORMATION, OUR PRIVATE SECTOR
[001:08:18;23] INFORMATION OR OUR PUBLIC 
[001:08:20;21] SECTOR INFORMATION.
[001:08:25;20] AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
[001:08:26;25] IT CLEAR THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 
[001:08:28;22] USE THE KIND OF TOOLS THAT WE 
[001:08:29;23] HAVE, WE DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE 
[001:08:30;21] IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WARFARE
[001:08:32;03] BUT WE WILL DEFEND THE CITIZENS
[001:08:33;29] OF THIS COUNTRY, AND THE 
[001:08:35;01] RUSSIANS NEED TO UNDERSTAND 
[001:08:36;02] THAT.
[001:08:36;22] I THINK THEY'VE BEEN TREATING 
[001:08:38;23] IT AS ALMOST A PROBING, HOW FAR
[001:08:40;23] WOULD WE GO? 
[001:08:41;24] HOW MUCH WOULD WE DO? 
[001:08:42;27] AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED
[001:08:44;29] WHEN DONALD PUBLICLY INVITED 
[001:08:47;26] PUTIN TO HACK INTO AMERICANS.
[001:08:54;00] THAT IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE.
[001:08:55;08] IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 50 
[001:08:57;04] NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS WHO
[001:09:01;02] SERVE IN PUBLIC INFORMATION HAS
[001:09:02;15] SAID THAT DONALD IS UNFIT TO BE
[001:09:04;12] THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
[001:09:05;10] IT'S COMMENTS LIKE THAT THAT 
[001:09:07;08] REALLY WORRY PEOPLE WHO 
[001:09:08;09] UNDERSTAND THE THREATS THAT WE 
[001:09:09;12] FACE. 
[001:09:09;23] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, YOU 
[001:09:10;16] HAVE TWO MINUTES ON THE SAME 
[001:09:13;07] QUESTION.
[001:09:13;20] DONALD TRUMP: AND I DO WANT TO 
[001:09:14;14] SAY THAT I WAS JUST ENDORSED 
[001:09:15;16] AND MORE ARE COMING NEXT WEEK.
[001:09:17;14] IT WILL BE OVER 200 ADMIRALS.
[001:09:19;13] MANY OF THEM ARE HERE.
[001:09:21;14] ADMIRALS AND GENERALS ENDORSED 
[001:09:24;15] ME TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY.
[001:09:27;16] THAT JUST HAPPENED AND MANY 
[001:09:30;17] MORE ARE COMING.
[001:09:31;20] I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.
[001:09:32;14] IN ADDITION, I WAS JUST 
[001:09:34;12] ENDORSED BY ICE.
[001:09:35;14] THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED ANYBODY 
[001:09:37;19] BEFORE ON IMMIGRATION.
[001:09:38;18] I WAS JUST ENDORSED BY ICE.
[001:09:40;13] I WAS JUST RECENTLY ENDORSED 
[001:09:43;10] 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS.
[001:09:45;14] WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS 
[001:09:46;26] ABOUT THIS,  I'LL TAKE THE 
[001:09:48;13] ADMIRALS AND I'LL TAKE THE 
[001:09:50;14] GENERALS ANY DAY OVER THE 
[001:09:51;05] POLITICAL HACKS THAT I SEE THAT
[001:09:52;19] HAVE LED OUR COUNTRY SO 
[001:09:54;14] BRILLIANTLY OVER THE LAST 10 
[001:09:55;15] YEARS WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE, 
[001:09:56;23] OKAY, BECAUSE LOOK AT THE MESS 
[001:09:57;22] THAT WE'RE IN.
[001:09:58;18] LOOK AT THE MESS WE'RE IN.
[001:09:59;20] AS FAR AS THE CYBER, I AGREE, 
[001:10:01;19] TO PARTS OF WHAT SECRETARY 
[001:10:04;17] CLINTON SAID.
[001:10:05;16] WE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN 
[001:10:07;02] ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE 
[001:10:08;23] NOT.
[001:10:09;03] I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS 
[001:10:09;26] THAT IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE 
[001:10:10;26] INTO THE DNC.
[001:10:11;25] SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, 
[001:10:14;23] RUSSIA.
[001:10:15;05] MAYBE IT WAS.
[001:10:15;25] IT COULD BE RUSSIA BUT IT COULD
[001:10:17;03] BE CHINA.
[001:10:18;27] IT COULD BE LOTS OF OTHER 
[001:10:20;24] PEOPLE.
[001:10:21;07] IT COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON
[001:10:22;07] THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 
[001:10:23;27] POUNDS, OKAY.
[001:10:24;26] YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO 
[001:10:26;26] DNC.
[001:10:27;06] BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC?
[001:10:29;00] WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS 
[001:10:30;12] WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR 
[001:10:37;02] PEOPLE, BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN 
[001:10:38;07] SCHULTZ.
[001:10:38;28] LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
[001:10:40;28] BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN 
[001:10:42;04] ADVANTAGE OF.
[001:10:43;00] NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, 
[001:10:44;02] WHETHER IT WAS CHINA WHETHER 
[001:10:45;03] IT WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE 
[001:10:46;10] DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE THE TRUTH 
[001:10:49;04] IS ANOTHER PRESIDENT OBAMA 
[001:10:51;04] WE'VE LOST CONTROL OF THINGS 
[001:10:51;27] THAT WE USED TO HAVE CONTROL 
[001:10:54;07] OVER.
[001:10:56;04] WE CAME IN WITH THE INTERNET, 
[001:10:57;13] WE CAME UP WITH THE INTERNET 
[001:10:59;13] AND I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON 
[001:11:00;07] AND MYSELF WOULD AGREE VERY 
[001:11:01;12] MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT ISIS
[001:11:02;09] IS DOING WITH THE INTERNET, 
[001:11:03;15] THEY'RE BEATING US AT OUR OWN 
[001:11:07;06] GAME ISIS.
[001:11:08;09] SO WE HAVE TO GET VERY TOUGH ON
[001:11:10;05] CYBER AND CYBER WARFARE.
[001:11:13;12] IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
[001:11:17;11] I HAVE A SON.
[001:11:17;26] HE'S 10 YEARS OLD.
[001:11:18;14] HE HAS COMPUTERS.
[001:11:19;12] HE IS SO GOOD WITH THESE 
[001:11:21;09] COMPUTERS.
[001:11:21;22] IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
[001:11:23;13] THE SECURITY ASPECT OF CYBER IS
[001:11:24;12] VERY TOUGH AND MAYBE IT'S 
[001:11:26;14] HARDLY DOABLE.
[001:11:28;15] BUT I WILL SAY, WE ARE NOT 
[001:11:30;15] DOING THE JOB WE SHOULD BE 
[001:11:31;21] DOING BUT THAT'S TRUE 
[001:11:33;15] THROUGHOUT OUR WHOLE 
[001:11:34;13] GOVERNMENTAL SOCIETY.
[001:11:36;12] WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE 
[001:11:37;23] TO DO BETTER LESTER AND CYBER 
[001:11:39;18] IS ONE OF THEM. 
[001:11:40;20] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[001:11:42;13] CLINTON. 
[001:11:42;26] HILLARY CLINTON: I THINK THERE 
[001:11:43;20] ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE 
[001:11:44;15] SHOULD BE ADDRESSING.
[001:11:45;15] I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO 
[001:11:48;18] DEFEAT ISIS.
[001:11:49;23] IT DOES INVOLVE GOING AFTER 
[001:11:51;01] THEM ONLINE.
[001:11:51;26] I THINK WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE
[001:11:54;24] WITH OUR TECH COMPANIES TO 
[001:11:57;22] PREVENT ISIS AND THEIR 
[001:11:59;23] OPERATIVES FROM BEING ABLE TO 
[001:12:03;25] USE THE INTERNET TO RADICALIZE 
[001:12:12;26] PEOPLE RADICALIZE 
[001:12:13;13] PEOPLE DIRECTLY IN OUR COUNTRY 
[001:12:14;07] AND EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, BUT 
[001:12:15;00] WE HAVE TO INTENSIFY OUR AIR 
[001:12:15;23] STRIKES AGAINST ISIS AND 
[001:12:16;15] EVENTUALLY SUPPORT OUR ARAB AND
[001:12:18;27] KURDISH PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:12:20;29] ACTUALLY TAKE OUT ISIS IN ROCCA
[001:12:26;02] AND THEIR CLAIM OF BEING AICAL ICALICAL
[001:12:32;04] ICALICAL ICALICAL 
[001:12:33;27] CALIPHATE.
[001:12:34;10] WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS WITH IRAQ
[001:12:35;08] AND WE'RE HOPING TO WITHIN A 
[001:12:38;09] YEAR MAKE PROGRESS OUT OF IRAQ 
[001:12:39;10] AND REALLY SQUEEZE THEM IN 
[001:12:41;10] SYRIA BUT WE HAVE TO BE 
[001:12:43;08] COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT 
[001:12:44;08] WE'VE HAD FOREIGN FIGHTERS 
[001:12:46;10] COMING TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE 
[001:12:48;13] FOREIGN MONEY, FOREIGN WEAPONS,
[001:12:50;12] SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS THE TOP
[001:12:53;08] PRIORITY AND I WOULD ALSO DO 
[001:12:55;10] EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE OUT
[001:12:56;16] THEIR LEADERSHIP.
[001:12:57;15] I WAS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF 
[001:12:59;12] EFFORTS TO TAKE OUT AL-QAIDA 
[001:13:02;13] LEADERSHIP WHEN I WAS SECRETARY
[001:13:03;07] OF STATE, INCLUDING OF COURSE 
[001:13:05;14] TAKING OUT BIN LADEN AND WE 
[001:13:09;16] HAVE TO GO AFTER BAGHDADY AS 
[001:13:12;25] WELL, MAKE IT ONE OF OUR 
[001:13:14;16] PRINCIPLES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO 
[001:13:15;19] DEFEAT ISIS AND HAVE TO DO 
[001:13:16;25] EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DISRUPT 
[001:13:17;26] THEIR PROPAGANDA EFFORTS 
[001:13:20;22] ONLINE. 
[001:13:21;04] LESTER HOLT:  WHEN YOU MENTION 
[001:13:22;18] ISIS, WE THINK OF ISIS OVER 
[001:13:24;19] THERE.
[001:13:25;00] BUT THERE HAVE BEEN AMERICAN 
[001:13:26;01] CITIZENS WHO HAVE BEEN INSPIRED
[001:13:27;22] TO COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR ON 
[001:13:29;24] AMERICAN SOIL, OF COURSE THE 
[001:13:32;23] LATEST ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND 
[001:13:36;27] KNIFE ATTACKS, AND SAN 
[001:13:39;00] BERNARDINO AND ORLANDO.
[001:13:40;00] I'LL ASK YOU BOTH, HOW WOULD 
[001:13:42;02] YOU PREVENT HOME-GROWN ATTACKS 
[001:13:43;29] BY AMERICAN CITIZENS? 
[001:13:45;01] DONALD TRUMP: FIRST, YOU HAVE 
[001:13:46;04] TO SAY ONE THING, VERY 
[001:13:47;27] IMPORTANT.
[001:13:48;10] SECRETARY CLINTON IS TALKING 
[001:13:49;03] ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS.
[001:13:49;29] WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS.
[001:13:54;29] PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY 
[001:13:56;07] CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE 
[001:13:58;03] WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ, 
[001:14:00;04] BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WHAT THEY 
[001:14:02;10] SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN.
[001:14:04;03] BUT ONCE THEY GOT IN, THE WAY 
[001:14:06;09] THEY GOT OUT WAS A DISASTER AND
[001:14:08;05] ISIS WAS FORMED.
[001:14:09;05] SHE TALKS ABOUT TAKING THEM 
[001:14:10;13] OUT.
[001:14:11;06] SHE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG 
[001:14:12;09] TIME.
[001:14:12;20] SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THEM 
[001:14:14;09] OUT A LONG TIME.
[001:14:15;11] BUT THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE 
[001:14:16;20] BEEN FORMED IF THEY LEFT SOME 
[001:14:18;10] TROOPS BEHIND, LIKE 10,000 OR 
[001:14:20;11] MAYBE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
[001:14:21;17] AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD 
[001:14:23;17] THEM.
[001:14:24;12] OR AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A 
[001:14:25;15] LONG TIME AND I THINK YOU'LL 
[001:14:26;28] AGREE BECAUSE I SAID IT TO YOU 
[001:14:33;12] ONCE.
[001:14:33;23] I BELIEVE TAKING THE OIL -- AND
[001:14:34;17] WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE 
[001:14:35;08] OIL -- ISIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
[001:14:36;02] ABLE TO FORM EITHER BECAUSE THE
[001:14:36;26] OIL WAS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF
[001:14:37;22] INCOME.
[001:14:38;04] AND NOW THEY HAVE THE OIL ALL 
[001:14:39;22] OVER THE PLACE INCLUDING A LOT 
[001:14:41;27] OF THE OIL IN LIBYA, WHICH WAS 
[001:14:43;23] ANOTHER ONE OF HER DISASTERS. 
[001:14:45;28] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[001:14:46;23] CLINTON. 
[001:14:47;06] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, I HOPE 
[001:14:48;00] THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING 
[001:14:49;06] UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY 
[001:14:51;28] WORKING HARD.
[001:14:55;27] DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION 
[001:14:57;04] OF IRAQ. 
[001:14:58;01] DONALD TRUMP: WRONG. 
[001:14:58;20] HILLARY CLINTON: THAT IS PROVED
[001:14:59;14] OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 
[001:15:00;04] DONALD TRUMP: WRONG. 
[001:15:01;01] HILLARY CLINTON: HE ACTUALLY 
[001:15:02;05] ADVOCATED FOR THE ACTIONS WE 
[001:15:03;03] TOOK IN LIB WRA LIBYA AND URGED
[001:15:10;29] QADDAFI BE TAKEN OUT AFTER 
[001:15:12;07] DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM.
[001:15:13;29] HE SAYS THIS CONSTANTLY, IS 
[001:15:17;02] GEORGE W. BUSH MADE THE 
[001:15:19;01] AGREEMENT ABOUT WHEN AMERICAN 
[001:15:21;01] TROOPS WOULD LEAVE IRAQ, NOT 
[001:15:24;03] OBAMA.
[001:15:24;14] AND THE ONLY WAY THAT AMERICAN 
[001:15:26;05] TROOPS COULD HAVE STAYED IN 
[001:15:27;04] IRAQ IS TO GET AN AGREEMENT 
[001:15:29;10] FROM THE THEN IRAQI GOVERNMENT 
[001:15:31;07] THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED OUR 
[001:15:33;11] TROOPS, AND THE IRAQI 
[001:15:36;07] GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT GIVE THAT.
[001:15:38;07] BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
[001:15:39;16] QUESTION YOU ASKED, LESTER.
[001:15:41;11] THE QUESTION YOU ASKED IS WHAT 
[001:15:42;10] DO WE DO HERE IN THE UNITED 
[001:15:43;17] STATES? 
[001:15:44;05] THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART 
[001:15:45;06] OF THIS.
[001:15:45;18] HOW DO WE PREVENT ATTACKS? 
[001:15:47;10] HOW DO WE PROTECT OUR PEOPLE? 
[001:15:49;11] AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO HAVE 
[001:15:53;11] AN INTELLIGENCE SURGE WHERE WE 
[001:15:55;11] ARE LOOKING FOR EVERY SCRAP OF 
[001:15:56;17] INFORMATION.
[001:15:57;01] I WAS SO PROUD OF LAW 
[001:15:58;16] ENFORCEMENT IN NEW YORK, IN 
[001:16:01;15] MINNESOTA, IN NEW JERSEY.
[001:16:02;16] YOU KNOW, THEY RESPONDED SO 
[001:16:04;13] QUICKLY, SO PROFESSIONALLY TO 
[001:16:05;06] THE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED BY 
[001:16:08;15] RAHAMI , AND THEY BROUGHT HIM 
[001:16:10;14] DOWN, AND WE MAY FIND OUT MORE 
[001:16:12;19] INFORMATION BECAUSE HE IS STILL
[001:16:14;16] ALIVE, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE AN
[001:16:17;15] INTELLIGENCE BENEFIT.
[001:16:18;17] SO WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING 
[001:16:20;24] WE CAN TO VACUUM UP 
[001:16:22;22] INTELLIGENCE FROM EUROPE FROM 
[001:16:23;23] THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT MEANS 
[001:16:25;20] WE'VE GOT TO WORK MORE CLOSELY 
[001:16:26;25] WITH OUR ALLIES.
[001:16:27;24] AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT 
[001:16:31;27] DONALD HAS BEEN VERY DISMISSIVE
[001:16:33;22] OF.
[001:16:34;02] WE ARE WORKING WITH NATO, THE 
[001:16:36;24] LONGEST MILITARY ALLIANCE IN 
[001:16:37;17] THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, TO 
[001:16:38;22] REALLY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO 
[001:16:40;23] TERRORISM.
[001:16:41;06] WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS 
[001:16:42;25] IN THE MIDDLE EAST MANY OF 
[001:16:43;28] WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE MUSLIM 
[001:16:46;29] MAJORITY NATIONS.
[001:16:49;25] DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY 
[001:16:53;26] INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD AND AT 
[001:16:55;29] HOME WHEN WE NEED TO BE 
[001:16:57;27] COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS
[001:17:00;00] AND THE MUSLIM AMERICAN 
[001:17:02;01] COMMUNITY.
[001:17:02;14] THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES.
[001:17:03;06] THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO
[001:17:04;07] US THAT WE MAY NOT GET ANYWHERE
[001:17:05;28] ELSE.
[001:17:06;09] THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING
[001:17:07;12] OPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT 
[001:17:08;11] IN THESE COMMUNITIES, NOT BE 
[001:17:10;29] ALIENATED AND PUSHED AWAY AS 
[001:17:13;06] SOME OF DONALD'S RHETORIC 
[001:17:15;07] UNFORTUNATELY HAS LED TO.
[001:17:19;03] LESTER HOLT:  PLEASE RESPOND. 
[001:17:21;10] DONALD TRUMP: THE SECRETARY 
[001:17:24;05] SAID VERY STRONGLY ABOUT 
[001:17:25;04] WORKING WITH -- WE'VE BEEN 
[001:17:26;09] WORKING WITH THEM FOR MANY 
[001:17:27;13] YEARS, AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST
[001:17:29;04] MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN.
[001:17:30;08] YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST.
[001:17:31;10] IT'S A TOTAL MESS.
[001:17:32;11] UNDER YOUR DIRECTION, TO A 
[001:17:34;08] LARGE EXTENT.
[001:17:34;23] BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE 
[001:17:36;09] EAST.
[001:17:36;20] YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL.
[001:17:39;11] THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU
[001:17:41;14] HAVE A COUNTRY READY TO FALL, 
[001:17:42;13] THEY WERE DOING SO BADLY.
[001:17:46;19] THEY WERE CHOKING ON THE 
[001:17:47;21] SANCTIONS AND THEY'RE GOING TO 
[001:17:49;18] BE A MAJOR POWER AT SOME POINT 
[001:17:51;17] THE WAY THEY'RE GOING.
[001:17:52;18] BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATO -- I 
[001:17:54;22] WAS ASKING ON A MAJOR SHOW, 
[001:17:56;23] WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NATO.
[001:17:57;22] I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
[001:17:59;18] BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE.
[001:18:00;08] I SAID, WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I 
[001:18:02;19] HAVEN'T GIVEN LOTS OF THOUGHT 
[001:18:03;12] TO NATO BUT TWO THINGS.
[001:18:04;22] NUMBER 1 THE 28 COUNTRIES OF 
[001:18:06;23] NATO, MANY OF THEM AREN'T 
[001:18:08;24] PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE.
[001:18:09;26] NUMBER 2, THAT BOTHERS ME, 
[001:18:11;25] BECAUSE WE'RE DEFENDING THEM 
[001:18:12;29] AND THEY SHOULD BE AT LEAST 
[001:18:14;05] PAYING US WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED
[001:18:15;23] TO BE PAYING BY TREATY AND 
[001:18:17;25] CONTRACT, AND, NUMBER 2, I SAID
[001:18:19;24] AND VERY STRONGLY, NATO COULD 
[001:18:20;29] BE OBSOLETE BECAUSE -- AND I 
[001:18:22;29] WAS VERY STRONG ON THIS, AND IT
[001:18:24;29] WAS ACTUALLY COVERED VERY 
[001:18:26;00] ACCURATELY IN THE NEW YORK 
[001:18:27;25] TIMES WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE 
[001:18:29;03] NEW YORK TIMES TO BE HONEST.
[001:18:30;03] BUT I SAID THEY DO NOT FOCUS ON
[001:18:33;27] TERROR, AND I WAS VERY STRONG.
[001:18:35;01] AND I SAID IT NUMEROUS TIMES.
[001:18:37;04] AND ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO I 
[001:18:39;02] READ ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE 
[001:18:40;29] WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT NATO 
[001:18:42;04] IS OPENING UP A MAJOR TERROR 
[001:18:45;05] DIVISION AND I THINK THAT'S 
[001:18:46;05] GREAT.
[001:18:47;02] AND I THINK WE SHOULD 
[001:18:47;21] GET -- BECAUSE WE PAY 
[001:18:49;07] APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE COST 
[001:18:52;05] OF NATO, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO
[001:18:54;11] PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I'M 
[001:18:56;13] ALL FOR NATO, BUT I SAID THEY 
[001:18:58;09] HAVE TO FOCUS ON TERROR ALSO.
[001:19:00;07] AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT.
[001:19:01;09] AND THAT WAS, BELIEVE ME, NOT 
[001:19:03;07] GOING TO GET CREDIT FOR IT, BUT
[001:19:05;07] THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF 
[001:19:06;10] WHAT I WAS SAYING AND MY 
[001:19:07;14] CRITICISM OF NATO.
[001:19:09;08] I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO 
[001:19:11;12] GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH 
[001:19:12;21] US IN ADDITION TO SURROUNDING 
[001:19:15;11] NATIONS, AND WE HAVE TO KNOCK 
[001:19:16;21] THE HELL OUT OF ISIS AND WE 
[001:19:18;12] HAVE TO DO IT FAST.
[001:19:19;12] WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM
[001:19:22;10] CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND 
[001:19:23;21] SECRETARY CLINTON, 
[001:19:25;14] AND -- BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE
[001:19:27;16] ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE 
[001:19:28;18] TROOPS -- NOT ONLY THAT, YOU 
[001:19:29;21] NAMED THE DAY -- THEY COULDN'T 
[001:19:31;23] BELIEVE IT.
[001:19:32;18] THEY SAT BACK AND SAID 
[001:19:34;19] PROBABLY -- WAIT A MINUTE.
[001:19:36;17] WHEN THEY FORMED -- THIS IS 
[001:19:38;18] SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD 
[001:19:39;10] HAVE HAPPENED.
[001:19:40;18] IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.
[001:19:41;26] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT
[001:19:42;25] ISIS, BUT YOU WERE THERE AND 
[001:19:44;24] YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE 
[001:19:45;26] WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE INFANT.
[001:19:47;26] NOW IT'S IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES.
[001:19:49;29] AND YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THEM? 
[001:19:51;29] I DON'T THINK SO.
[001:19:52;16] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, A LOT 
[001:19:53;10] OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT 
[001:19:54;26] QUESTIONS.
[001:19:55;09] YOU HAVE SUPPORTED THE WAR IN 
[001:19:57;28] IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION.
[001:19:59;01] WHAT MAKES YOUR JUDGMENT. 
[001:20:00;08] DONALD TRUMP: I DID NOT SUPPORT
[001:20:01;06] THE WAR IN IRAQ.
[001:20:03;00] THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA 
[001:20:07;00] NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE
[001:20:08;07] SHE FRANKSLY, I THINK THE BEST 
[001:20:13;03] PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAIN 
[001:20:15;03] STREAM MEDIA.
[001:20:18;00] WAIT A MINUTE.
[001:20:18;15] I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. 
[001:20:19;09] LESTER HOLT:  THE RECORD SHOWS 
[001:20:21;02] OTHERWISE. 
[001:20:21;16] DONALD TRUMP: IT DOES NOT SHOW 
[001:20:23;04] THAT.
[001:20:23;15] THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M 
[001:20:24;12] RIGHT.
[001:20:25;03] WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH 
[001:20:26;13] HOWARD STERN, VERY LIGHTLY, 
[001:20:28;08] FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME 
[001:20:30;03] THAT, I SAID VERY LIGHTLY, I 
[001:20:32;08] DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, WHO KNOWS, 
[001:20:34;05] ESSENTIALLY.
[001:20:34;19] I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH 
[001:20:38;07] NEIL CAVUTO.
[001:20:41;09] WE TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS 
[001:20:42;16] MORE IMPORTANT.
[001:20:44;11] I THEN SPOKE TO SEAN HANITY.
[001:20:48;11] I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS 
[001:20:49;21] WITH SEAN HANITY AT FOX SPSHGS 
[001:20:53;13] HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY AND 
[001:20:56;20] I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT, HE 
[001:20:58;20] SAID YOU WERE TOTALLY AGAINST 
[001:20:59;24] IT, EXCUSE ME, IT WAS BEFORE 
[001:21:00;28] THE WAR STARTED.
[001:21:03;20] SEAN HANITY SAID STRONGLY, TO 
[001:21:04;29] ME AND OTHER PEOPLE AND HE'S 
[001:21:06;00] WILLING TO SAY BUT NOBODY WANTS
[001:21:07;25] TO CALL HIM.
[001:21:08;24] HE SAID I WAS AGAINST THE WAR.
[001:21:10;22] HE USED TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH ME 
[001:21:12;26] BECAUSE SEAN WAS IN FAVOR OF 
[001:21:13;29] THE WAR.
[001:21:14;23] AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SIDE 
[001:21:16;27] ALSO, NOT VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE 
[001:21:18;00] SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.
[001:21:19;27] NOBODY CALLS SEAN HANITY AND 
[001:21:20;24] THEY DID AN ARTICLE IN THE 
[001:21:22;06] MAJOR MAGAZINE SHORTLY AFTER 
[001:21:23;05] THE WAR STARTED I THINK IN '04,
[001:21:25;28] BUT THEY DID AN ARTICLE WHICH 
[001:21:27;27] HAD ME TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR 
[001:21:29;02] IN IRAQ, AND ONE OF YOUR 
[001:21:32;27] COMPATRIATES SAID YOU KNOW, 
[001:21:34;00] WHETHER IT WAS BEFORE OR RIGHT 
[001:21:36;02] AFTER, TRUMP WAS 
[001:21:37;02] DEFINITELY -- IF YOU READ THIS 
[001:21:39;00] ARTICLE, THERE WAS NO DOUBT.
[001:21:40;29] IF SOMEBODY WOULD CALL UP SEAN 
[001:21:43;02] HANITY -- THIS WAS BEFORE THE 
[001:21:44;01] WAR STARTED, HE AND I USED TO 
[001:21:46;09] HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WAR.
[001:21:47;07] I SAID IT'S A TERRIBLE AND A 
[001:21:49;04] STUPID THING.
[001:21:50;03] IT'S GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE 
[001:21:51;13] MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT'S EXACTLY
[001:21:53;04] WHAT IT'S DONE.
[001:21:54;10] LESTER HOLT:  MY REFERENCE IS 
[001:21:55;11] TO WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN 2002, 
[001:21:57;08] AND MY QUESTION WAS, WHY IS 
[001:22:01;09] YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT 
[001:22:02;14] THAN MRS. CLINTON. 
[001:22:03;11] DONALD TRUMP: I HAVE MUCH 
[001:22:05;08] BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES.
[001:22:06;14] THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
[001:22:07;13] I ALSO HAVE MUCH BETTER 
[001:22:09;14] TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS, YOU 
[001:22:11;10] KNOW.
[001:22:11;21] I HAVE MUCH BETTER -- LET ME 
[001:22:12;14] TELL YOU.
[001:22:13;10] SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS 
[001:22:14;18] OF DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING UBER 
[001:22:20;09] KNOW
[001:22:20;29] -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON 
[001:22:22;15] AVENUE INTO A ROOM.
[001:22:23;12] I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET 
[001:22:25;13] MAYBE BY FAR IS BY TEMPERAMENT.
[001:22:27;17] I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT.
[001:22:29;16] I KNOW HOW TO WIN.
[001:22:30;14] SHE DOES NOT.
[001:22:33;10] THE OTHER DAY, BEHIND THE BLUE 
[001:22:36;15] SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU 
[001:22:37;08] WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY 
[001:22:38;18] CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY 
[001:22:39;23] OUT OF CONTROL.
[001:22:40;19] I SAID THERE'S A PERSON WITH A 
[001:22:42;18] TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT A 
[001:22:44;16] PROBLEM. 
[001:22:44;29] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[001:22:46;18] CLINTON. 
[001:22:47;01] HILLARY CLINTON: WELL, OKAY.
[001:22:48;16] [LAUGHTER] 
[001:22:59;21] LET'S TALK ABOUT TWO IMPORTANT 
[001:23:00;15] ISSUES THAT WERE BRIEFLY 
[001:23:01;06] MENTIONED BY DONALD.
[001:23:01;24] FIRST, NATO.
[001:23:02;08] NATO AS A MILITARY ALLIANCE
[001:23:03;09] LET'S TALK ABOUT HAS
[001:23:03;27] SOMETHING CALLED ARTICLE 5 AND 
[001:23:05;24] BASICALLY IT SAYS THIS: AN 
[001:23:07;01] ATTACK ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON 
[001:23:08;27] ALL.
[001:23:09;08] AND DO YOU KNOW THE ONLY TIME 
[001:23:11;01] IT'S EVER BEEN INVOKED AFTER 
[001:23:13;26] 9/11, WHEN THE 28 NATIONS OF 
[001:23:15;27] NATO SAID THAT THEY WOULD GO TO
[001:23:18;28] AFGHANISTAN WITH US TO FIGHT 
[001:23:23;00] TERRORISM, SOMETHING THAT THEY 
[001:23:24;09] STILL ARE DOING BY OUR SIDE, 
[001:23:29;00] WITH RESPECT TO IRAN WHEN I 
[001:23:31;04] BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, IRAN
[001:23:32;05] WAS WEEKS AWAY FROM HAVING 
[001:23:35;01] ENOUGH NUCLEAR MATERIAL TO FORM
[001:23:37;03] A BOMB.
[001:23:41;03] THEY HAD MASTERED THE NUCLEAR 
[001:23:44;05] FUEL CYCLE, THEY HAD STOPPED 
[001:23:46;12] THEM WITH CENTER FUGES THAT 
[001:23:47;12] WERE WHIRLING AWAY, AND WE HAD 
[001:23:49;11] SANCTIONED THEM.
[001:23:49;27] I VOTED FOR EVERY SANCTION 
[001:23:52;15] AGAINST IRAN WHEN I WAS IN THE 
[001:23:53;17] SENATE BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH.
[001:23:55;12] SO I SPENT A YEAR AND-A-HALF 
[001:23:59;10] PUTTING TOGETHER A COALITION 
[001:24:00;21] THAT INCLUDED RUSSIA AND CHINA 
[001:24:03;11] TO IMPOSE THE TOUGHEST 
[001:24:04;14] SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND WE DID 
[001:24:06;16] DRIVE THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING 
[001:24:07;17] TABLE, AND MY SUCCESSOR, JOHN 
[001:24:11;12] KERRY, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA KNOT
[001:24:16;13] A DEAL THAT PUT A LID ON THE 
[001:24:19;16] IRAN NUCLEAR PROBLEM WITHOUT 
[001:24:21;18] FIRING A SINGLE SHOT.
[001:24:24;03] THAT'S 
[001:24:29;14] THAT'S DIPLOMACY, COALITION 
[001:24:30;06] BUILDING AND WORKING WITH OTHER
[001:24:31;00] NATIONS.
[001:24:31;12] THE OTHER DAY, I SAW DONALD 
[001:24:32;04] SAYING THERE WERE SOME IRANIAN 
[001:24:33;16] SAILORS OFF THE SHORES OF IRAN 
[001:24:35;18] AND THEY WERE TAUNTING AMERICAN
[001:24:36;26] SAILORS ON A NEARBY SHIP.
[001:24:37;24] HE SAID YOU KNOW IF THEY 
[001:24:39;19] TAUNTED OUR SAILORS, I'D BLOW 
[001:24:41;21] THEM OUT OF THE WATER AND START
[001:24:43;16] ANOTHER WAR.
[001:24:48;17] THAT IS NOT GOOD JUDGMENT.
[001:24:49;18] THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT 
[001:24:50;22] TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER IN 
[001:24:52;20] CHIEF, TO BE TAUNTED.
[001:24:54;24] AND THE WORST PART I HEARD 
[001:24:58;23] DONALD SAY HAS BEEN ABOUT 
[001:24:59;23] NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
[001:25:00;09] HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE 
[001:25:02;05] DIDN'T CARE IF OTHER NATIONS 
[001:25:04;25] GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS JAPAN, 
[001:25:07;00] SOUTH KOREA, EVEN SAUDI ARABIA,
[001:25:08;27] IT HAS BEEN THE POLICY OF THE 
[001:25:10;05] UNITED STATES, DEMOCRATS AND 
[001:25:11;28] REPUBLICANS, TO DO EVERYTHING 
[001:25:13;03] WE COULD TO REDUCE THE 
[001:25:15;26] PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR 
[001:25:18;03] WEAPONS.
[001:25:18;15] HE EVEN SAID IF THERE WERE 
[001:25:20;02] NUCLEAR WAR IN EAST ASIA WELL, 
[001:25:22;06] YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE, YOU 
[001:25:23;06] KNOW HAVE A GOOD TIME, FOLKS.
[001:25:26;00] AND, IN FACT, HIS CAVALIER 
[001:25:28;00] ATTITUDE ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
[001:25:30;04] IS SO DEEPLY TROUBLING, THAT IS
[001:25:34;01] THE NUMBER 1 THREAT WE FACE IN 
[001:25:35;07] THE WORLD, AND IT BECOMES 
[001:25:37;09] PARTICULARLY THREATENING IF 
[001:25:39;02] TERRORISTS EVER GET THEIR HANDS
[001:25:41;05] ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL.
[001:25:42;13] SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY
[001:25:45;03] A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS 
[001:25:47;08] FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE 
[001:25:49;05] NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK
[001:25:51;10] ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT 
[001:25:53;09] THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED 
[001:25:54;16] DONALD TRUMP: THAT IS GETTING A
[001:25:55;14] LITTLE BIT OLD, I MUST SAY. 
[001:25:56;17] HILLARY CLINTON: IT'S A GOOD 
[001:25:58;08] ONE THOUGH.
[001:25:58;22] WELL DESCRIBES THE PROBLEM. 
[001:26:00;14] DONALD TRUMP: IT'S NOT AN 
[001:26:01;16] ACCURATE ONE AT ALL.
[001:26:03;11] NOT AN ACCURATE ONE.
[001:26:04;11] I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LOT OF 
[001:26:06;14] THINGS TO RESPOND.
[001:26:07;01] I AGREE WITH HER ON ONE THING.
[001:26:08;17] THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM THE
[001:26:10;13] WORLD HAS IS NUCLEAR ARMAMENT, 
[001:26:14;17] NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
[001:26:15;16] NOT GLOBAL WARMING LIKE YOU 
[001:26:17;18] THINK AND YOUR PRESIDENT 
[001:26:20;18] THINKS.
[001:26:21;00] NUCLEAR IS THE SINGLE GREATEST 
[001:26:22;21] THREAT.
[001:26:23;03] JUST TO GO DOWN THE LIST, WE 
[001:26:25;23] DEFEND JAPAN.
[001:26:26;28] WE DEFEND GERMANY.
[001:26:27;27] WE DEFEND SOUTH KOREA.
[001:26:28;27] WE DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA.
[001:26:30;29] WE DEFEND COUNTRIES.
[001:26:32;03] THEY DO NOT PAY US WHAT THEY 
[001:26:34;02] SHOULD BE PAYING US BECAUSE WE 
[001:26:35;04] ARE PROVIDING TREMENDOUS 
[001:26:36;09] SERVICE AND WE ARE LOSING A 
[001:26:37;29] FORTUNE.
[001:26:38;28] THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOSING.
[001:26:40;02] WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING.
[001:26:42;28] WHO MAKES THESE -- WE LOSE ON 
[001:26:44;03] EVERYTHING.
[001:26:44;17] ALL I SAID, THAT IT'S VERY 
[001:26:46;05] POSSIBLE THAT IF THEY DON'T PAY
[001:26:48;04] A FAIR SHARE -- BECAUSE THIS 
[001:26:51;02] ISN'T 40 YEARS AGO WHERE WE 
[001:26:52;15] COULD DO WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WE
[001:26:54;03] CAN'T DEFEND JAPAN, A 
[001:26:57;11] BEHEMMOTH, SELLING US CARS BY 
[001:26:58;11] THE MILLIONS. 
[001:26:59;08] LESTER HOLT:  WE NEED TO MOVE 
[001:27:00;07] ON. 
[001:27:00;17] DONALD TRUMP: WAIT, IT'S VERY 
[001:27:02;08] IMPORTANT.
[001:27:02;21] THEY MAY HAVE TO DEFEND 
[001:27:04;04] THEMSELVES OR THEY MAY HAVE TO 
[001:27:05;05] HELP US OUT, A COUNTRY THAT 
[001:27:07;06] OWES $20 TRILLION.
[001:27:08;10] THEY HAVE TO HELP US OUT.
[001:27:09;10] AS FAR AS THE NUCLEAR IS 
[001:27:11;09] CONCERNED, I AGREE.
[001:27:13;06] IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST 
[001:27:16;14] THREAT THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS. 
[001:27:18;10] LESTER HOLT:  MY NEXT QUESTION 
[001:27:19;17] AS WE HEAD TO THE LAST SEGMENT
[001:27:21;15] ON THE SUBJECT OF SECURING 
[001:27:24;15] AMERICA, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, 
[001:27:27;16] PRESIDENT OBAMA REPORTEDLY 
[001:27:28;08] CHANGING THE NATION'S LONG 
[001:27:31;20] STANDING POLICY.
[001:27:32;06] DO YOU SUPPORT THE CURRENT 
[001:27:32;28] POLICY? 
[001:27:33;10] MR.  NATION'S LONG 
[001:27:38;08] STANDING POLICY.
[001:27:38;24] DO YOU SUPPORT THE CURRENT 
[001:27:39;16] POLICY? 
[001:27:39;28] MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES
[001:27:40;22] ON THAT. 
[001:27:41;05] DONALD TRUMP: I HAVE TO SAY 
[001:27:41;27] THAT FOR WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON
[001:27:42;21] WAS SAYING ABOUT NUCLEAR WITH 
[001:27:43;14] RUSSIA, SHE'S VERY CAVALIER IN 
[001:27:44;08] THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT VARIOUS
[001:27:45;04] COUNTRIES, BUT RUSSIA HAS BEEN 
[001:27:45;28] A STANDING -- THEY HAVE A MUCH 
[001:27:46;24] NEWER CAPABILITY THAN WE DO.
[001:27:49;23] WE HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATING FROM 
[001:27:50;26] THE NEW STANDPOINT.
[001:27:52;28] I LOOKED THE OTHER NIGHT.
[001:27:53;26] I WAS SEEING B-52S.
[001:27:55;22] THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH THAT YOUR 
[001:27:56;22] FATHER AND GRANDFATHER COULD BE
[001:27:57;29] FLYING THEM.
[001:27:58;23] WE ARE NOT KEEPING UP WITH 
[001:27:59;29] OTHER COUNTRIES.
[001:28:00;26] I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO END 
[001:28:02;22] IT, JUST GET RID OF IT, BUT NOT
[001:28:05;27] TO FIRST STRIKE.
[001:28:07;23] I THINK THAT ONCE THE NUCLEAR 
[001:28:10;28] ALTERNATIVE HAPPENS, IT'S OVER.
[001:28:12;03] AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO BE
[001:28:14;29] PREPARED.
[001:28:15;12] I CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING OFF THE 
[001:28:16;05] TABLE, BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SOME
[001:28:17;06] OF THESE COUNTRIES YOU LOOK AT
[001:28:19;02] NORTH KOREA.
[001:28:19;16] WE'RE DOING NOTHING THERE.
[001:28:21;06] CHINA SHOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM
[001:28:22;19] FOR US.
[001:28:23;06] CHINA SHOULD GO INTO NORTH 
[001:28:25;05] KOREA.
[001:28:27;07] CHINA IS TOTALLY POWERFUL AS IT
[001:28:30;07] RELATES TO NORTH KOREA.
[001:28:32;08] BY THE WAY, ANOTHER ONE 
[001:28:33;12] POWERFUL IS THE WORST DEAL I 
[001:28:37;15] EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED IS THE 
[001:28:38;15] IRAN DEAL.
[001:28:39;15] IRAN HAS POWER OVER NORTH 
[001:28:41;12] KOREA.
[001:28:41;23] WHEN THEY MADE THAT HORRIBLE 
[001:28:42;25] DEAL WITH IRAN, IT SHOULD HAVE 
[001:28:45;16] INCLUDED THE FACT THAT THEY DO 
[001:28:47;16] SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO NORTH
[001:28:49;17] KOREA.
[001:28:50;15] AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
[001:28:52;28] SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO YEMEN
[001:28:53;22] AND ALL THESE OTHER PLACES.
[001:28:54;17] AND WHEN ASKED TO SECRETARY 
[001:28:57;18] KERRY, WHY DIDN'T DO YOU THAT? 
[001:29:01;22] WHY DIDN'T YOU ADD OTHER THINGS
[001:29:02;16] INTO THE DEAL? 
[001:29:03;02] ONE OF THE GREAT GIVE AWAYS OF 
[001:29:04;17] ALL TIME, OF ALL TIME, 
[001:29:07;22] INCLUDING $400 MILLION IN CASH
[001:29:08;17] NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN THAT 
[001:29:09;17] BEFORE, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE 
[001:29:11;23] WRONG.
[001:29:12;04] IT WAS ACTUALLY $1.7 BILLION IN
[001:29:14;21] CASH OBVIOUSLY, I GUESS FOR 
[001:29:17;06] THE HOSTAGES, IT CERTAINLY 
[001:29:18;26] LOOKS THAT WAY.
[001:29:19;27] SO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, WHY 
[001:29:22;29] DIDN'T THEY MAKE THE RIGHT 
[001:29:24;00] DEAL? 
[001:29:24;25] THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS 
[001:29:30;07] EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY IN 
[001:29:30;29] HISTORY.
[001:29:32;29] WOULD LEAD TO NUCLEAR PROBLEMS.
[001:29:37;10] ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS SET BACK 
[001:29:38;04] 10 YEARS AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO
[001:29:39;13] DO MUCH.
[001:29:41;06] I MET WITH NETANYAHU THE OTHER 
[001:29:48;13] DAY.
[001:29:48;23] HE IS NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. 
[001:29:50;13] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY 
[001:29:52;10] CLINTON. 
[001:29:52;23] HILLARY CLINTON: THEY REALLY 
[001:29:54;10] MATTER WHEN YOU RUN FOR 
[001:29:55;16] PRESIDENT AND WHEN YOU ARE 
[001:29:56;20] PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO 
[001:29:57;12] REASSURE OUR ALLIES IN JAPAN 
[001:30:00;15] AND SOUTH KOREA AND ELSEWHERE 
[001:30:02;14] THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL DEFENSE 
[001:30:04;14] TREATIES, AND WE WILL HONOR 
[001:30:06;17] THEM.
[001:30:07;14] IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AMERICA'S 
[001:30:08;22] WORD BE GOOD.
[001:30:10;17] AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS 
[001:30:12;17] CAMPAIGN HAS CAUSED SOME 
[001:30:14;17] QUESTIONING AND SOME WORRIES ON
[001:30:15;26] THE PART OF MANY LEADERS ACROSS
[001:30:24;29] THE GLOBE.
[001:30:25;12] I HAVE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF 
[001:30:26;06] THEM.
[001:30:26;17] BUT I WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF 
[001:30:27;10] MYSELF, AND I THINK ON BEHALF 
[001:30:28;03] OF THE ACROSS
[001:30:28;18] THE GLOBE. MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN
[001:30:29;23] PEOPLE SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR 
[001:30:30;25] WORD IS GOOD.
[001:30:32;25] IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE 
[001:30:37;25] LOOK AT THE ENTIRE GLOBAL 
[001:30:39;02] SITUATION.
[001:30:39;26] THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE 
[001:30:41;01] OTHER PROBLEMS WITH IRAN, BUT 
[001:30:44;02] PERSONALLY I'D RATHER DEAL 
[001:30:56;12] WITH PROBLEMS RATHER DEAL 
[001:30:57;06] WITH PROBLEMS HAVING PUT THAT 
[001:30:57;29] LID ON THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN
[001:30:58;23] STILL TO BE FACING THAT AND 
[001:30:59;15] DONALD NEVER TELLS YOU WHAT HE 
[001:31:00;09] WOULD DO.
[001:31:00;22] WOULD HE HAVE STARTED A WAR? 
[001:31:01;15] WOULD HE HAVE BOMBED IRAN? 
[001:31:02;07] IF HE'S GOING TO CRITICIZE A 
[001:31:03;00] DEAL THAT HAS BEEN VERY 
[001:31:03;20] SUCCESSFUL IN GIVING US ACCESS 
[001:31:04;17] TO IRANIAN FACILITIES THAT WE 
[001:31:05;13] NEVER HAD BEFORE, THEN HE 
[001:31:07;07] SHOULD TELL US WHAT HIS 
[001:31:10;07] ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE.
[001:31:10;26] IT'S LIKE HIS PLAN TO DEFEAT 
[001:31:12;09] ISIS.
[001:31:14;05] HE SAYS IT'S A SECRET PLAN BUT 
[001:31:16;10] THE ONLY SECRET IS THAT HE HAS 
[001:31:19;12] NO PLAN.
[001:31:19;24] SO WE NEED TO BE MORE PRECISE 
[001:31:20;18] IN HOW WE TALK ABOUT THESE 
[001:31:22;21] ISSUES.
[001:31:23;03] PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FOLLOW 
[001:31:25;13] OUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SO 
[001:31:28;11] CLOSELY TRYING TO GET HINTS 
[001:31:29;15] ABOUT WHAT WE WILL DO.
[001:31:31;16] CAN THEY RELY ON US? 
[001:31:34;13] ARE WE GOING TO LEAD THE WORLD 
[001:31:35;19] WITH STRENGTHS AND IN 
[001:31:39;18] ACCORDANCE WITH OUR VALUES? 
[001:31:40;24] THAT'S WHAT I ENTEND TO DO.
[001:31:44;20] I INTEND TO BE A LEADER OF OUR 
[001:31:45;14] COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE CAN COUNT 
[001:31:46;07] ON, BOTH HERE AT HOME AND 
[001:31:47;00] AROUND THE WORLD TO MAKE 
[001:31:50;00] DECISIONS THAT WILL FURTHER 
[001:31:50;22] PEACE AND PROSPERITY, BUT ALSO 
[001:31:53;04] STAND UP TO BULLIES, WHETHER 
[001:31:54;01] THEY'RE ABROAD OR AT HOME.
[001:31:56;22] WE CANNOT LET THOSE WHO WOULD 
[001:31:59;22] TRY TO DESTABILIZE THE WORLD TO
[001:32:01;26] INTERFERE WITH AMERICAN 
[001:32:05;29] INTERESTS AND SECURITY, AND 
[001:32:06;21] GIVEN ANY OPPORTUNITIES AT ALL.
[001:32:08;27] LESTER HOLT:  YOUR TWO MINUTES 
[001:32:10;00] HAVE EXPIRED. 
[001:32:10;15] DONALD TRUMP: I'D LIKE TO SAY 
[001:32:11;28] SOMETHING REALLY QUICKLY. 
[001:32:13;01] LESTER HOLT:  REALLY QUICKLY. 
[001:32:14;01] DONALD TRUMP: I WILL TELL YOU 
[001:32:15;01] THAT HILLARY WILL TELL YOU TO 
[001:32:17;09] GO TO HER WEB SITE AND READ 
[001:32:19;02] ABOUT HOW TO DEFEAT ISIS, WHICH
[001:32:22;00] COULD HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY NOT
[001:32:23;01] HAVING IT GET GOING IN THE 
[001:32:24;10] FIRST PLACE.
[001:32:25;05] IT'S GETTING TOUGHER AND 
[001:32:26;07] TOUGHER BECAUSE THEY'RE IN MORE
[001:32:27;11] AND MORE PLACES, MORE AND MORE 
[001:32:29;04] STATES AND MORE AND MORE 
[001:32:30;07] NATIONS AND IT'S A BIG PROBLEM 
[001:32:31;13] AND AS FAR AS JAPAN IS 
[001:32:32;16] CONCERNED I WANT TO HELP ALL OF
[001:32:34;15] OUR ALLIES, BUT WE ARE LOSEING 
[001:32:38;15] BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 
[001:32:40;08] DOLLARS.
[001:32:40;20] WE CANNOT BE THE POLICEMEN OF 
[001:32:42;18] THE WORLD.
[001:32:43;10] WE CANNOT PROTECT COUNTRIES ALL
[001:32:45;07] OVER THE WORLD WHEN THEY'RE NOT
[001:32:48;07] PAYING US WHAT WE NEED. 
[001:32:49;12] LESTER HOLT:  JUST A FEW FINAL 
[001:32:51;16] QUESTIONS. 
[001:32:52;00] DONALD TRUMP: SHE DOESN'T SAY 
[001:32:52;24] THAT BECAUSE SHE HAS NO 
[001:32:54;17] BUSINESS ABILITY.
[001:32:55;16] WE NEED HEART AND A LOT OF 
[001:32:56;19] THINGS BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE 
[001:32:59;14] SOME BUSINESS ABILITY.
[001:33:00;13] SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT.
[001:33:02;17] A LOT OF THE THINGS SHE'S 
[001:33:04;16] TALKING ABOUT COULD HAVE BEEN 
[001:33:05;09] TAKEN CARE OF IN THE LAST 10 
[001:33:06;21] YEARS WHEN SHE HAD GREAT POWER 
[001:33:08;19] BUT THEY WEREN'T TAKEN CARE OF 
[001:33:09;22] AND IF SHE WINS THIS 
[001:33:11;22] PRESIDENCY, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN
[001:33:13;21] CARE OF. 
[001:33:15;23] LESTER HOLT:  SECRETARY CLINTON
[001:33:17;22] IS THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED BY
[001:33:21;02] A PARTY.
[001:33:27;02] YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE 
[001:33:28;09] LOOK.
[001:33:28;20] WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT. 
[001:33:30;03] DONALD TRUMP: SHE DOESN'T HAVE 
[001:33:31;04] THE LOOK OR THE STAM NACHLT SHE
[001:33:32;10] DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA.
[001:33:34;06] TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS 
[001:33:35;03] COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS 
[001:33:37;11] STAM NACHLT WAIT A MINUTE, 
[001:33:40;02] LESTER, YOU ASKED ME A 
[001:33:42;02] QUESTION.
[001:33:42;15] DID YOU ASK ME A QUESTION? 
[001:33:43;11] YOU YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:33:45;07] NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS.
[001:33:46;09] YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:33:48;09] NEGOTIATE TEST SITES WITH 
[001:33:50;07] JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA.
[001:33:52;14] CAN YOU IMAGINE WITH THIS WITH 
[001:33:55;18] SAUDI ARABIA, WITH ALL THE 
[001:33:57;10] MONEY DEFENDING THEM AND THEM 
[001:33:59;13] NOT PAYING YOU HAVE SO MANY 
[001:34:02;21] THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:34:04;18] DO AND I BELIEVE HILLARY HAS 
[001:34:06;15] THE STAMINA. 
[001:34:07;18] LESTER HOLT:  LET'S LET HER 
[001:34:10;15] RESPOND. 
[001:34:10;28] HILLARY CLINTON: AS SOON AS HE 
[001:34:11;24] TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND 
[001:34:13;15] NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A 
[001:34:14;20] CEASE FIRE, A RELEASE OF 
[001:34:20;24] DISDANCE AND OPENING OF NEW 
[001:34:21;28] OPPORTUNITIES AND NATIONS 
[001:34:23;20] AROUND THE WORLD OR EVEN SPENDS
[001:34:25;25] A LITTLE BIT OF HOURS 
[001:34:27;19] TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF A 
[001:34:29;19] CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN
[001:34:30;22] TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA.
[001:34:37;01] [APPLAUSE]. 
[001:34:37;15] DONALD TRUMP: WELL, LET ME TELL
[001:34:38;09] YOU.
[001:34:38;19] HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE, BUT 
[001:34:39;11] IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE.
[001:34:39;29] WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS 
[001:34:42;07] DURING THE LAST.
[001:34:43;01] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
[001:34:44;00] SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, I 
[001:34:45;07] THINK, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD 
[001:34:47;05] EXPERIENCE.
[001:34:47;19] WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT
[001:34:49;10] YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE 
[001:34:51;04] YOU GAVE THEM $150 BILLION 
[001:34:53;04] BACK.
[001:34:53;15] WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL.
[001:34:56;04] WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING -- YOU 
[001:34:59;07] ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL.
[001:35:00;13] I AGREE SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE 
[001:35:02;09] BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE AND 
[001:35:03;10] THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO 
[001:35:04;14] HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT
[001:35:10;08] TYPE OF EXPERIENCE.
[001:35:10;26] [CHEERING] 
[001:35:11;10] LESTER HOLT:  WE ARE AT THE 
[001:35:14;12] FINAL QUESTION. 
[001:35:14;28] HILLARY CLINTON: ONE THING 
[001:35:15;20] QUICKLY.
[001:35:16;02] HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS 
[001:35:16;27] TO STAMINA.
[001:35:17;18] THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED 
[001:35:20;13] WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS.
[001:35:24;20] AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID 
[001:35:28;20] PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE 
[001:35:30;19] TO EMPLOYERS. 
[001:35:31;04] DONALD TRUMP: I NEVER SAID 
[001:35:32;19] THAT. 
[001:35:33;00] HILLARY CLINTON: WHO HAS SAID 
[001:35:33;23] THEY DON'T DESERVE EQUAL PAY 
[001:35:34;29] UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS
[001:35:36;27] MEN AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
[001:35:38;01] HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A 
[001:35:43;24] BEAUTY CONTEST.
[001:35:44;10] HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, 
[001:35:49;00] SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING 
[001:35:49;22] AROUND THEM.
[001:35:50;06] AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN "MISS 
[001:35:54;25] PIGGY."  
[001:35:55;08] THEN HE CALLED HER "MISS 
[001:35:56;26] HOUSEKEEPING" BECAUSE SHE WAS 
[001:35:58;02] LA TINA.
[001:35:58;26] SHE HAS A NAME. 
[001:36:00;00] DONALD TRUMP: WHERE DID SHE 
[001:36:01;04] FIND THIS. 
[001:36:02;03] HILLARY CLINTON: SHE HAD BECOME
[001:36:03;01] A U.S. CITIZEN AND YOU CAN BET 
[001:36:05;01] SHE'S GOING TO VOTE THIS 
[001:36:06;02] NOVEMBER. 
[001:36:06;15] DONALD TRUMP: OKAY GOOD.
[001:36:08;29] [CHEERING] 
[001:36:09;13] DONALD TRUMP: LET ME JUST TELL 
[001:36:11;03] YOU.
[001:36:11;13] LESTER HOLT:  10 SECONDS AND 
[001:36:12;11] THE FINAL QUESTION. 
[001:36:13;11] DONALD TRUMP: HILLARY HAS HIT 
[001:36:14;06] ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS.
[001:36:17;12] SOME OF IT'S ENTERTAINMENT.
[001:36:18;04] SOME OF IT SAID SOMEBODY WHO 
[001:36:21;08] USED TO BE NEAR ME ROSIE O'DON
[001:36:27;23] O'DONNELL  I THINK YOU WOULD 
[001:36:28;17] AGREE SHE DESERVED IT AND 
[001:36:30;11] NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER.
[001:36:32;12] BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY TO 
[001:36:35;08] HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I 
[001:36:36;14] SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT.
[001:36:41;15] I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
[001:36:42;03] IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.
[001:36:42;21] IT'S NOT NICE.
[001:36:43;06] BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF 
[001:36:44;23] MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE
[001:36:47;12] ADS ON ME, MANY OF WHICH ARE 
[001:36:49;15] ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE.
[001:36:50;14] THEY'RE UNTRUE AND THEY'RE 
[001:36:52;13] MISREPRESENTATIONS AND I WILL 
[001:36:53;06] TELL YOU THIS LESTER, IT IS NOT
[001:36:55;22] NICE AND I DON'T DESERVE THAT,
[001:36:59;24] BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE 
[001:37:00;18] THING THAT SHE'S DONE.
[001:37:01;20] IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
[001:37:04;18] ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING 
[001:37:06;01] THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME 
[001:37:09;24] IN TODAY, AND WITH ALL OF THAT 
[001:37:10;18] MONEY, OVER $200 MILLION SPENT 
[001:37:13;21] AND EITHER WINNING OR TIED AND 
[001:37:15;23] I SPENT PRACTICALLY NOTHING. 
[001:37:17;03] LESTER HOLT:  ONE OF YOU WILL 
[001:37:17;26] NOT WIN THIS ELECTION SO MY 
[001:37:19;22] FINAL QUESTION TO YOU TONIGHT 
[001:37:20;23] IS ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT 
[001:37:24;01] THE OUTCOME AS THE WILL OF THE 
[001:37:25;25] VOTERS? 
[001:37:26;25] SECRETARY CLINTON. 
[001:37:27;13] HILLARY CLINTON: I SUPPORT OUR 
[001:37:30;24] DACHSHUND
[001:37:31;27] DEMOCRACY.
[001:37:32;10] SOMETIMES YOU WIN AND SOMETIMES
[001:37:33;06] YOU LOSE BUT I CERTAINLY WILL 
[001:37:34;27] SUPPORT THE OUTCOME OF THIS 
[001:37:36;05] ELECTION AND I KNOW DONALD IS 
[001:37:39;03] TRYING VERY HARD TO PLANT 
[001:37:39;28] DOUBTIT BUT I HOPE THE PEOPLE 
[001:37:42;02] OUT THERE UNDERSTAND, THIS 
[001:37:44;02] ELECTION IS UP TO YOU.
[001:37:45;05] IT'S NOT ABOUT US SO MUCH AS IT
[001:37:50;11] IS ABOUT YOU AS THE FAMILIES 
[001:37:51;04] AND THE KINDS OF FUTURES THAT 
[001:37:51;27] YOU WANT SO I CERTAINLY HOPE 
[001:37:52;22] YOU WILL GET OUT AND VOTE AS 
[001:37:54;07] THOUGH YOUR FUTURE DEPENDED ON 
[001:37:56;04] IT BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES. 
[001:37:57;09] LESTER HOLT:  MR. TRUMP, VERY 
[001:37:58;04] QUICKLY, WILL YOU ACCEPT THE 
[001:38:00;05] OUTCOME OF THE VOTERS? 
[001:38:01;09] DONALD TRUMP: I WANT TO MAKE 
[001:38:02;11] AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[001:38:03;09] WE ARE A NATION THAT IS 
[001:38:05;08] SERIOUSLY TROUBLED.
[001:38:06;06] WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS.
[001:38:07;14] PEOPLE ARE POURING INTO OUR 
[001:38:08;16] COUNTRY.
[001:38:09;09] THE OTHER DAY, WE WERE 
[001:38:10;15] DEPORTING 800 PEOPLE AND 
[001:38:11;22] PERHAPS THEY PASSED THE WRONG 
[001:38:14;22] BUTTON PRESSED THE WRONG 
[001:38:16;16] BUTTON OR PERHAPS WORSE THAN 
[001:38:17;15] THAT, IT WAS CORRUPTION.
[001:38:18;13] BUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE 
[001:38:19;20] GOING TO DEPORT FOR GOOD REASON
[001:38:21;15] ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS 
[001:38:23;16] ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS.
[001:38:25;16] AND IT WAS 800 AND NOW IT TURNS
[001:38:27;19] OUT IT MIGHT BE 1800 AND THEY 
[001:38:29;22] DON'T EVEN KNOW. 
[001:38:30;21] LESTER HOLT:  WILL YOU ACCEPT 
[001:38:31;22] THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION? 
[001:38:32;26] DONALD TRUMP: I WANT TO MAKE 
[001:38:34;23] AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[001:38:35;23] I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.
[001:38:37;20] I DON'T BELIEVE HILLARY WILL.
[001:38:38;13] THE ANSWER IS, IF SHE WINS, I 
[001:38:41;02] WILL ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT HER. 
[001:38:41;25] LESTER HOLT:  ALL RIGHT.
[001:38:44;29] THAT IS GOING TO DO IT FOR US.
[001:38:45;22] THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEBATE FOR 
[001:38:46;15] THIS EVENING.
[001:38:47;00] IT WAS A SPIRITED ONE.
[001:38:47;21] WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND.
[001:38:48;25] NOT EVERYTHING AS WE EXPECTED 
[001:38:52;02] IT WOULD BE.
[001:38:53;25] THE INCOME SCHEDULED DEBATE IS

[001:39:08;02] VIRGINIA.

[001:47:00;07] >> THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL

[001:48:15;00] BUT I WANT TO START WITH A 
[001:48:16;06] TWEET THAT WE FOUND HERE AT 
[001:48:19;03] C-SPAN ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT 
[001:48:21;29] CAME UP WAS GLOBAL WARMING AND 
[001:48:23;05] THIS WAS A TWEET THAT DONALD 
[001:48:24;08] TRUMP SENT ON NOVEMBER 6, 2012.
[001:48:28;02] THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL WARMING 
[001:48:30;04] WAS CREATED BY AND FOR THE 
[001:48:32;00] CHINESE IN ORDER TO MAKE U.S. 
[001:48:34;06] MANUFACTURING NON-COMPETITIVE.
[001:48:37;00] AGAIN, THAT'S FROM 2012.
[001:48:39;06] WE CHECKED SOME MEMBERS OF 
[001:48:40;11] CONGRESS TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE 
[001:48:42;03] TWEETING OUT ABOUT THE DEBATES 
[001:48:43;08] SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME
[001:48:45;07] OF THOSE.
[001:48:46;06] THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE JEFF 
[001:48:47;06] DUNCAN THE REPUBLICAN OF SOUTH
[001:48:49;09] CAROLINA.
[001:48:49;22] CLINTON SAID TRUMP WAS HIDING 
[001:48:51;11] SOMETHING.
[001:48:52;05] WHERE ARE THE E-MAILS, HILLARY?
[001:48:54;08] SECRET PRIVATE SERVER AND FIFTH
[001:48:56;06] AMENDMENT TESTIMONIES? 
[001:48:57;08] WHO IS HIDING SOMETHING? 
[001:48:58;15] AND SENATOR RAND PAUL LIVE 
[001:49:03;10] TWEETED THE DEBATE AS WELL.
[001:49:04;13] HOW CAN HILLARY SAY SHE IS FOR 
[001:49:06;13] JOBS WHEN SHE HAS STATED SHE 
[001:49:08;13] WILL PUT KENTUCKY COAL MINERS 
[001:49:09;23] OUT OF BUSINESS AND 
[001:49:12;15] REPRESENTATIVE EARL 
[001:49:15;13] BLOOMENHOUER OF OREGON LIVE 
[001:49:16;20] TWEETED THE DEBATE: I TOTALLY 
[001:49:19;16] BELIEVE THAT TRUMP DID NO 
[001:49:20;19] FORMAL DEBATE PREPARATION AND 
[001:49:22;16] FINALLY THIS TWEET FROM 
[001:49:24;17] CONGRESSMAN BREND AN BOYLE NEAR
[001:49:27;17] PHILADELPHIA: TO ALL PEOPLE OF 
[001:49:29;21] THE WORLD, I RESPECTFULLY 
[001:49:30;28] REQUEST YOU PLEASE NOT WATCH 
[001:49:31;26] THIS DEBATE.
[001:49:32;22] PLEASE LOOK AWAY.
[001:49:33;19] THANK YOU.
[001:49:35;18] >> AND I'LL BE READING SOME OF 
[001:49:37;28] YOUR TWEETS FROM THE GENERAL 
[001:49:39;19] PUBLIC.

[001:49:55;29] EAT KNOWTOWN, NEW JERSEY WHO 
[001:49:57;28] SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP.
[001:49:58;27] DID TONIGHT'S RACE CHANGE THE 
[001:50:01;28] RACE I THINK. 
[001:50:03;02] CALLER: I'M NOT SURE.
[001:50:04;00] I'M UNDECIDED BUT FIRMLY IN THE
[001:50:06;29] CAMP OF DONALD TRUMP.
[001:50:07;25] I THINK WE SAW THE DIFFERENCE 
[001:50:10;00] BETWEEN A SEASONED POLITICIAN 
[001:50:12;28] LIKE HILLARY WHO'S BEEN IN THE 
[001:50:15;10] POLITICS FOR ALL THESE YEARS 
[001:50:17;04] AND DONALD TRUMP WHO DIDN'T 
[001:50:18;08] SPEND ALL THE TIME PREPARING 
[001:50:19;12] BUT YET GOT HIS MESSAGE ACROSS.
[001:50:22;04] HOST: OKAY, THANKS.
[001:50:23;07] NEXT UP IS ELSA.
[001:50:25;07] ELSA IS WATCHING US IN NEW PORT

[001:50:31;11] SUPPORTER.

[001:50:34;13] CALLER: YES, I FIRMLY AGREE 
[001:50:36;15] WITH EVERYTHING THAT TRUMP HAD 
[001:50:37;22] TO SAY.
[001:50:38;10] I DO AGREE WITH THAT LAST 
[001:50:42;16] CALLER.
[001:50:43;09] I DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW, HE HAS
[001:50:45;13] ALL THE EXPERIENCE OF HILLARY 
[001:50:46;14] BUT I DO THINK THAT HE HAS BEEN
[001:50:51;21] IN THE BACKGROUND INVOLVING 
[001:50:57;14] POLITICS.
[001:50:57;27] HE JUST HASN'T BEEN IN THE 
[001:50:58;24] FRONT LINES AND I THINK HE IS 
[001:51:05;18] VERY PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT, 
[001:51:06;21] AND HE WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY A
[001:51:11;21] BETTER PLACE AND PREPARE TO BE 
[001:51:16;26] A GREAT AMERICA AGAIN. 
[001:51:18;03] HOST: ELSA, THANKS SO MUCH.
[001:51:20;00] BLUE HONEY ON TWITTER SAYS 
[001:51:23;23] UNSATISFIED WITH LESTER HOLT'S

[001:51:31;28] SUPPORTER OF SECRETARY CLINTON.
[001:51:33;02] DID TONIGHT CHANGE ANYTHING DO
[001:51:35;01] YOU THINK? 
[001:51:35;29] CALLER: I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTING
[001:51:37;05] CLINTON ALL THE WAY BECAUSE I 
[001:51:38;06] FEEL THAT ACTUALLY TRUMP IS 
[001:51:39;29] GOING TO MAKE MORE ENEMIES THAN
[001:51:41;29] HE WILL ACTUALLY KEEP WORLD 
[001:51:44;02] PEACE.
[001:51:44;28] CALLER: AND MY NAME IS BONNIE 
[001:51:46;29] BLAKE.
[001:51:47;10] I BELIEVE HE HAS NO POLITICS 
[001:51:51;06] STENT.
[001:51:51;28] I BELIEVE SHE'S IN THE BSZ
[001:51:56;11] BUSINESS.
[001:51:56;24] THIS IS HER BUSINESS AND SHE 
[001:51:57;18] IS A FINE AND UPSTANDING 
[001:51:59;04] REPRESENTATION FOR OUR AMERICA.

[001:52:09;01] CALLER: HI.
[001:52:11;01] SO I AM A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
[001:52:13;02] I'VE BEEN A TRUMP SUPPORTER 
[001:52:14;08] THROUGH THE PRIMARIES.
[001:52:15;09] BUT I MUST SAY I'M A LITTLE 
[001:52:19;04] DISAPPOINTED IN TRUMP'S MESSAGE
[001:52:22;12] TONIGHT AND I THINK IT WAS 
[001:52:24;12] RIGHT THERE FOR THE TAKING 
[001:52:27;11] BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE HILLARY 
[001:52:28;17] CLINTON DRESSED IN RED HAS THE 
[001:52:30;15] BLOOD OF THE -- 
[001:52:31;10] HOST: ALL RIGHT, SIR, LET'S 
[001:52:32;16] MOVE ON TO ROCHELLE IN CAPITAL 
[001:52:37;18] HEIGHTS, MARYLAND SUPPORTING 
[001:52:39;19] HILLARY CLINTON. 
[001:52:40;06] CALLER: HI.
[001:52:41;13] [CHOPPY AUDIO] 
[001:52:43;17] HOST: APOLOGIES BUT YOUR PHONE 
[001:52:44;22] IS NOT TRANSMITTING WELL.
[001:52:46;17] PLEASE CALL US BACK.
[001:52:47;17] NEXT UP IS KERRY IN KENTUCKY.
[001:52:51;20] YOU'RE ON. 
[001:52:52;04] CALLER: YES.
[001:52:52;19] I WAS UNDECIDED UNTIL THIS 
[001:52:56;19] DEBATE IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT
[001:52:59;23] TRUMP -- THAT DONALD TRUMP 
[001:53:02;19] REALLY IS -- HE DOESN'T HAVE 
[001:53:04;26] THE TEMPERAMENT.
[001:53:06;25] HE WAS SNIFFING ALL THE TIME.
[001:53:08;23] HE WAS YELLING ALL THE TIME.
[001:53:11;25] HE SEEMED EXTREMELY VOLATILE 
[001:53:14;24] AND I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT 
[001:53:18;24] HE HAS -- HE'D BE TOO CLOSE TO 
[001:53:20;28] THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, IN MY 
[001:53:23;26] VIEW.
[001:53:25;26] HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:53:27;01] NEGOTIATE.
[001:53:27;26] HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO 
[001:53:29;02] ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND STAY 
[001:53:31;02] ON TRACK IN ANYTHING THAT HE'S 
[001:53:33;07] SAYING.
[001:53:33;27] THE MODERATOR HAD TO TELL HIM 
[001:53:36;29] REPEATEDLY THAT IS NOT THE 
[001:53:37;21] QUESTION.
[001:53:39;29] YOU HAVE TO NOT ANSWERED THE 
[001:53:40;22] QUESTION.
[001:53:42;04] THIS IS THE QUESTION.
[001:53:43;08] AND IF HIS MIND CAN'T STAY ON 
[001:53:46;13] THE QUESTION AND CAN ONLY BRAG 
[001:53:50;02] ABOUT WHAT ENDORSEMENTS HE'S 
[001:53:52;03] GOT AND HIS COMPANY IT SEEMS 
[001:53:54;08] LIKE HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN 
[001:53:56;06] HIS COMPANY AND HIS BUSINESS 
[001:53:59;11] THAN HE IS IN RUNNING THE 
[001:54:01;09] COUNTRY. 
[001:54:01;22] HOST: AND HAD YOU BEEN 
[001:54:03;04] UNDECIDED BEFORE THIS DEBATE? 
[001:54:04;10] CALLER: YES, I WAS.
[001:54:07;08] AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT I WOULD
[001:54:09;11] VOTE FOR THAT MAN, NOT AFTER 
[001:54:11;17] SEEING THIS DEBATE. 
[001:54:15;12] HOST: THANK YOU FOR THE CALL.
[001:54:17;08] PETER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE? 
[001:54:20;08] PETER: DURING THE 90 MINUTES 
[001:54:21;16] THEY WERE ON THE STAGE, WE LEFT
[001:54:23;08] THE TWITTER COUNTER ON HERE AND
[001:54:25;08] FOR THE HASHTAGS DEBATE AND 
[001:54:27;10] DEBATES 2016, OVER 10,000 
[001:54:29;13] TWEETS CAME INTO OUR FEED JUST 
[001:54:31;11] ON THOSE TWO SITES.
[001:54:33;11] BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER 
[001:54:35;20] TWEETS WE WANTED TO SHARE WITH 
[001:54:37;14] YOU.
[001:54:37;24] THIS IS DARRUOUS MENSA.
[001:54:39;18] SOMEWHERE OUT THERE, A FACT 
[001:54:41;16] CHECKER JUST DECIDE OF A FIERCE
[001:54:44;16] EMPATHETIC REBOUND.
[001:54:45;04] WE'LL READ SOME MORE AFTER WE 
[001:54:47;18] LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP IN THE 
[001:54:49;18] SPIN ROOM.
[001:54:54;19] DONALD TRUMP:  I ENJOYED THAT 
[001:54:55;28] AND I VERY MUCH ENJOYED 
[001:54:56;29] TONIGHT.
[001:54:57;11] YOU KNOW THAT.
[001:54:57;27] IT'S ABOUT MAKING AMERICA GREAT
[001:55:00;20] AGAIN AND I THINK WE'RE GOING 
[001:55:01;13] TO BE WELL ON OUR WAY TO DOING 
[001:55:02;23] IT, AND WE'VE SEEN THE VOTES 
[001:55:03;27] AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS 
[001:55:06;25] MORNING, THE VOTES CAME OUT ON 
[001:55:09;23] YOUR SHOW.
[001:55:14;23] I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A LOT IN 
[001:55:15;26] OUR COUNTRY.
[001:55:16;10] AND YOU KNOW WHAT CAME UP TO ME
[001:55:19;23] MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, SHE 
[001:55:20;27] TALKS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS 
[001:55:21;19] SHE'S GOING TO DO.
[001:55:23;02] WHERE HAS SHE BEEN FOR 26 
[001:55:24;26] YEARS? 
[001:55:25;08] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[001:55:26;25] GOOD LUCK.
[001:55:32;28] >> I REALLY THINK IT'S ABOUT 
[001:55:36;02] MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[001:55:41;01] WORKING ON THINGS AND NOTHING 
[001:55:43;07] EVER GETS DONE.
[001:55:52;03] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
[001:56:37;18] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
[001:56:45;24] >> HOW MUCH HAS SHE SPENT ON 
[001:56:48;21] COMMERCIALS? 
[001:56:49;06] OVER $200 MILLION.
[001:56:54;24] >> ONE MORE QUESTION FROM THE 
[001:56:56;06] MEDIA, AS THE DEBATE ENDS AND 
[001:56:57;29] PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW 
[001:56:59;06] DID YOU AND HOW SHE DID.
[001:57:00;26] WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ROLE OF 
[001:57:01;19] THE MEDIA IS AT THIS POINT? 
[001:57:04;02] DONALD TRUMP:  I WISH THE 
[001:57:06;03] MEDIA -- I JUST WANT THEM TO BE
[001:57:08;00] FAIR.
[001:57:08;11] THAT INCLUDES YOU.
[001:57:22;02] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
[001:57:24;06] >> AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT 
[001:57:26;06] YOUR E-MAILS TEXTS TWEETS AND
[001:57:28;08] PHONE CALLS.
[001:57:30;01] THIS IS A TEXT FROM DUANE IN 
[001:57:31;11] NORTH TEXAS.
[001:57:32;04] HE SAID ONE CANDIDATE DIDN'T 
[001:57:34;06] KNOW HIS MATERIAL WELL ENOUGH 
[001:57:36;09] AND THE OTHER THINKS VOTERS ARE
[001:57:38;02] STUPID.
[001:57:39;03] WHEN WILL THIRD PARTIES GET THE
[001:57:41;07] EARNED SPOT LIGHT AND, IN FACT
[001:57:43;06] JILL STEIN DR. JILL STEIN OF 
[001:57:46;13] THE GREEN PARTY WAS ESCORTED 
[001:57:49;08] OFF HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS 
[001:57:50;22] AHEAD OF THE DEBATE.
[001:57:53;08] WE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MS NBC
[001:57:55;10] AND DID NOT HAVE THE PROPER 
[001:57:57;09] CREDENTIALS SO THEY TOOK HER 
[001:57:58;13] OFF.
[001:57:59;08] A COUPLE OF MORE TWEETS THAT 
[001:58:00;01] HAVE COME IN.
[001:58:01;09] THIS IS ABBEY, LEAST ENVIED JOB
[001:58:03;15] IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS FACT 
[001:58:06;12] CHECKER.
[001:58:06;24] KATE SAYS, I HOPED THAT THE 
[001:58:08;16] TRUMPED UP TRICKLE-DOWN CATCH 
[001:58:11;13] PHRASE STICKS.
[001:58:12;14] THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PLAY ON 
[001:58:14;11] WORDS AND FINALLY, HERE IS 
[001:58:16;15] SENATOR COREY BOOKER.
[001:58:18;14] GLAD HRC IS CALLING TRUMP OUT 
[001:58:23;14] ON HIS DEGRADING COMMENTS ABOUT
[001:58:25;25] WOMEN.
[001:58:26;10] IT'S NOT ABOUT STAMINA BUT 
[001:58:31;16] DECENCY TO BE PRESIDENT. 
[001:58:32;18] HOST: LET'S GO BACK TO RENE.
[001:58:34;17] YOU'RE ON RENE.
[001:58:35;19] DID TONIGHT CHANGE ANYTHING? 
[001:58:36;23] CALLER: NO.
[001:58:37;16] WELL, YEAH, IT DID BECAUSE I 
[001:58:43;15] THINK THAT MY -- HE REALLY 
[001:58:48;18] WASN'T TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO 
[001:58:49;12] HELP US AMERICANS AND TRYING TO
[001:58:51;17] CHANGE THE COUNTRY AND HE WAS 
[001:58:55;24] TARGETED IN CHICAGO, ONLY 
[001:58:58;27] CHICAGO.
[001:59:00;25] HOST: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL.
[001:59:02;01] DONALD TRUMP IS CONTINUING TO 
[001:59:03;26] WORK THE SPIN ROOM.
[001:59:04;25] UNUSUAL FOR A CANDIDATE GOING 
[001:59:06;01] IN TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE 
[001:59:07;05] MEDIA AFTER THE DEBATE.
[001:59:09;00] WE'RE GOING TO BE LISTENING TO 
[001:59:09;24] YOU AND NEXT IS A CALL FROM 
[001:59:14;27] DEIDRE WHO'S WATCHING US IN 
[001:59:18;00] BATAVIA, OHIO.
[001:59:18;15] A SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP.
[001:59:20;04] DID TONIGHT CHANGE YOUR OPINION
[001:59:21;09] OF THE CANDIDATE OR THE 
[001:59:22;03] CAMPAIGN? 
[001:59:22;16] CALLER: I THINK WHAT IT DID FOR
[001:59:24;03] ME WAS CONFIRM MY DECISION WITH
[001:59:26;07] TRUMP.
[001:59:27;04] A LOT OF STUFF TONIGHT WAS 
[001:59:28;03] BASED ON FACTS WITH BOTH 
[001:59:32;04] CANDIDATES.
[001:59:32;18] I THINK THE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO
[001:59:34;09] BE RESOLVED FOR THE WHOLE 
[001:59:36;09] ENTIRE WORLD IS THAT WE ARE 
[001:59:40;10] BECOMING VERY POOR MIDDLE 
[001:59:41;14] CLASS.
[001:59:42;09] EVEN OUR SCHOOLS ARE NOT 
[001:59:45;11] SUPPORTED.
[001:59:45;24] THEY'RE CHALLENGED WITH COMMON 
[001:59:47;12] CORE.
[001:59:47;23] WE HAVE THE HEART TO REBUILD 
[001:59:50;16] AMERICA
[001:59:54;00] AMERICA.
[001:59:54;15] HE HAS BEEN BULLYING HILLARY.
[001:59:55;21] HE IS NOT USING THE THINGS HE 
[001:59:57;23] COULD USE.
[001:59:58;15] HE'S NOT DEMEANING
[002:00:16;09] HE WILL BRING OUR JOBS BACK.
[002:00:24;05] I WANT EVERYBODY TO PUT YOUR
[002:00:24;25] TRUST AND FAITH IN THIS MAN
[002:00:27;16] BECAUSE HE IS FOR THE PEOPLE, BY
[002:00:28;08] THE PEOPLE.
[002:00:31;04] THAT HAS REALLY MADE ME KIND OF
[002:00:31;26] DISCUSS IT WITH HILLARY BECAUSE
[002:00:35;13] SHE HAS HAD SO MANY EXPERIENCES
[002:00:36;15] AND OPPORTUNITIES TO DO ALL THE
[002:00:40;03] THINGS SHE IS SAYING SHE CAN DO
[002:00:40;25] NOW.
[002:00:41;03] IT IS TOO LATE.
[002:00:43;03] WE NEED TO GET SOMEBODY IN THERE
[002:00:45;14] WHO CAN GET IT DONE.
[002:00:47;03] PENCE WILL HELP SUPPORT AMERICA
[002:00:48;23] AND I THANK YOU GUYS FOR
[002:00:51;17] LETTING ME BE PART OF THIS.
[002:00:53;06] I THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[002:00:56;16] >> THANK YOU DEIRDRE FOR
[002:00:59;15] WATCHING.
[002:01:00;07] UP NEXT IS A COMMENT FROM
[002:01:02;16] BRIDGET IN TALLAHASSEE.
[002:01:06;07] YOU ARE ON C-SPAN.
[002:01:06;22] WELCOME.
[002:01:07;02] >> I AM A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT.
[002:01:11;10] NOT NECESSARILY A VOTING
[002:01:11;28] DEMOCRAT.
[002:01:14;10] MY STATEMENT, OR MY OPINION, IS
[002:01:15;18] THAT THE MODERATOR WAS NOT AS
[002:01:21;22] STRONG AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
[002:01:22;13] THAT IS WHAT MY VIEW IS.
[002:01:24;12] CAN SOMEBODY COMMENT ON THAT?
[002:01:26;22] >> WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
[002:01:29;02] LIKED TO SEE FROM HIM?
[002:01:32;14] >> MORE AGGRESSIVE, COMING
[002:01:35;26] IN SAAS THE MODERATOR.
[002:01:39;14] THEY MODERATOR IS SOMEBODY WHO
[002:01:42;14] WHEN THE CONVERSATION
[002:01:43;01] BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES IS GOING
[002:01:44;24] BACK AND FORTH THEN HE, AS A
[002:01:47;23] MODERATOR, SHOULD COME IN AND
[002:01:50;13] SAY, "OK LET'S STOP THIS AND
[002:01:54;28] LET'S GET TO THE ISSUES."
[002:01:57;26] I FEEL LIKE, HE WAS NOT DOING
[002:02:01;02] HIS JOB AS WELL AS HE SHOULD
[002:02:03;03] HAVE BEEN.
[002:02:03;14] >> THANK YOU, BRIDGET.
[002:02:07;15] UP NEXT IS DAN, IT WAS IN
[002:02:09;29] WATCHING US FROM GLADWIN
[002:02:15;19] MICHIGAN, AND HE IS SUPPORTING
[002:02:16;10] DONALD TRUMP.
[002:02:16;23] >> HOW CAN WE SUPPORT HILLARY
[002:02:19;06] CLINTON WHEN ALL SHE DOES IS
[002:02:19;27] SELL OUT OUR COUNTRY?
[002:02:21;00] DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO CLIMB
[002:02:25;03] HIS WAY TO THE TOP ONE HILLARY
[002:02:26;18] CLINTON HAS ALREADY BEEN ON THE
[002:02:27;10] DROP.
[002:02:28;18] SHE IS BACKED BY OUR PRESIDENT
[002:02:31;18] WHO HAS BEEN LYING AND CONNIVING
[002:02:32;10] AND DECEIVING OUR WHOLE COUNTRY
[002:02:33;02] THE WHOLE EIGHT YEARS HE HAS
[002:02:35;27] BEEN IN THERE.
[002:02:37;18] HOST: DAN, LET ME MOVE YOU TO
[002:02:40;07] THE DEBATE.
[002:02:42;19] WHAT WAS THE MOMENT FOR YOU THAT
[002:02:43;11] WAS THE BEST?
[002:02:43;24] CALLER: THE WHOLE THING ON
[002:02:47;29] DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY
[002:02:48;17] CLINTON, YOU CAN SEE THE SMUG
[002:02:49;29] LOOK ON HER FACE, LIKE, "I'M
[002:02:53;01] GONNA WIN, I HAVE CONNECTIONS
[002:02:57;05] ALL OF THE WORLD AND I'M BLAH
[002:02:59;26] BLAH THIS."
[002:03:03;19] HOST: PEOPLE WROTE CLINTON
[002:03:10;20] LOOKED AT TRUMP LIKE A PRESCHOOL
[002:03:11;13] TEACHER WAITING FOR A DRUNK
[002:03:12;03] TODDLER TO FINALLY LIE DOWN FOR
[002:03:13;04] A NAP.
[002:03:13;23] >> THE DEBATE HAS NOW COME TO A
[002:03:16;14] CLOSE.
[002:03:16;23] MY OPINIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.
[002:03:19;25] WHY DID I EVEN WATCH?
[002:03:22;25] HERE IS WHAT AMY HAS TO SAY.
[002:03:24;26] WELL, AT LEAST THIS DEBATE WAS
[002:03:26;08] INTERESTING AND LIVELY.
[002:03:27;26] MY EARS ONLY GLAZED OVER THREE
[002:03:30;14] TIMES.
[002:03:30;26] NANCY PUTS OUT UNSCIENTIFIC
[002:03:35;11] TIEM OME POLL 62%, THINK HILLARY
[002:03:40;14] WON.
[002:03:41;05] NEW YORK NBC HAS THIS TWEET.
[002:03:43;25] THEY MISSPELLED HILLARY'S NAME
[002:03:46;13] ON THE DEBATE 2016 TICKET.
[002:03:49;12] THEY ONLY USED ONE "L" IN HER
[002:03:53;04] FIRST NAME.
[002:03:55;23] HOST: UP NEXT, A SUPPORTER OF
[002:03:59;12] DONALD TRUMP.
[002:03:59;26] CALLER: I FEEL THAT HILLARY HAS
[002:04:03;26] BEEN IN POLITICS FOR 30 YEARS.
[002:04:10;26] SHE HAS BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE
[002:04:11;18] AND SENATOR.
[002:04:12;26] WHEN SHE FIRST WENT IN, SHE DID
[002:04:16;17] NOT KNOW ANYTHING, BUT SHE
[002:04:17;06] LEARNED WHEN SHE WENT ON.
[002:04:20;05] THE ONLY THING IS, AS SECRETARY
[002:04:21;03] OF STATE WHY DID SHE SEE FOUR
[002:04:24;05] AMERICANS KILLED AND NOT GO OVER
[002:04:27;10] THERE AND SEND HELP?
[002:04:30;26] EVERYBODY IS FORGETTING ABOUT
[002:04:31;17] LIBYA.
[002:04:31;26] SHE WAS IN CHARGE.
[002:04:33;08] AND WE WANT HER IN CHARGE OF
[002:04:36;15] OUR COUNTRY AFTER ALL THE
[002:04:37;27] AMERICANS DIED, SHE CRASHED HER
[002:04:38;27] E-MAILS, SHE GOT RID OF THEM?
[002:04:41;27] THIS IS THE PERSON WE ARE GOING
[002:04:42;19] TO TRUST?
[002:04:43;00] AND YET, SHE HAS GOT GUTS TO
[002:04:46;08] TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
[002:04:47;28] HE IS COMING IN.
[002:04:48;29] HE IS NOT AN EXPERIENCE
[002:04:53;05] D POLITICIAN.
[002:04:57;00] I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEBODY WHO
[002:04:57;22] IS NOT A POLITICIAN COME IN
[002:05:00;06] AND CLEAN UP WASHINGTON.
[002:05:03;01] I THINK DONALD TRUMP DID VERY
[002:05:04;15] WELL.
[002:05:04;24] HILLARY, YES.
[002:05:05;07] SHE WENT ON AND ON AND ON.
[002:05:08;01] DONALD TRUMP IS JUST COMING IN
[002:05:08;22] AS AN OUTSIDER.
[002:05:11;01] AND HE WAS VERY RESPECTFUL TO
[002:05:14;10] HILLARY.
[002:05:14;20] HE COULD'VE REALLY GOT ON HER
[002:05:17;10] BUT HE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER
[002:05:18;21] AND HE SHOWED RESPECT, BUT
[002:05:20;03] HILLARY DOES NOT SHOW RESPECT TO
[002:05:20;25] ANYBODY AND THIS IS THE PERSON
[002:05:21;21] SHE IS.
[002:05:24;03] SHE DOES NOT RESPECT ANYBODY.
[002:05:24;24] HOST: RITA, THANKS SO MUCH.
[002:05:28;04] ON TWITTER LUIS WRITES, TRUMP
[002:05:32;14] IS NOT FIT FOR THE POSITION OF
[002:05:35;16] THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA, MAYBE
[002:05:37;16] FOR WALMART, SAFEWAY OR
[002:05:39;14] WALGREENS.
[002:05:39;25] NEXT IS HELEN SUPPORTING
[002:05:42;18] HILLARY CLINTON.
[002:05:43;02] HI HELEN.
[002:05:44;17] CALLER: HI.
[002:05:49;08] I JUST WANT TO SAY I AM VERY
[002:05:49;28] PROUD WITH HILLARY CLINTON WITH
[002:05:52;18] A CLASSIC REPRESENTATION.
[002:05:53;07] WITH OUR NEEDS FOR AMERICA.
[002:05:55;08] HER SMILE IS MOST WELCOME AT
[002:05:57;22] THIS TIME WHEN WE NEED IT MORE
[002:05:59;26] THAN EVER.
[002:06:00;07] THANK YOU.
[002:06:00;27] HOST: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL.
[002:06:04;09] DAVE IS UP NEXT.
[002:06:05;23] HE IS WATCHING US IN MICHIGAN.
[002:06:07;10] WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING QUESTION
[002:06:09;26] MARK HE CALLED IN ON OUR OTHER
[002:06:11;21] LINE.
[002:06:12;10] CALLER: I AM NOT SURE WHO I AM
[002:06:15;23] SUPPORTING AND THE DEBATE DID
[002:06:16;14] NOT HELP ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
[002:06:19;23] I THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
[002:06:20;28] AS TO WHY WE NEED TO INCLUDE
[002:06:22;08] THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES AFTER THE
[002:06:23;28] FIASCO WE JUST WATCHED.
[002:06:24;16] HOST: HOW DO YOU THINK THE
[002:06:25;28] MODERATION WENT?
[002:06:27;11] DID IT HELP YOU?
[002:06:31;12] WOULD YOU OFFER SUGGESTIONS
[002:06:32;02] ABOUT HOW A FUTURE DEBATE MIGHT
[002:06:32;25] BE BETTER INFORMATIVE?
[002:06:34;12] CALLER: I FEEL EVERYTHING THEY
[002:06:36;29] DISCUSSED WAS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
[002:06:38;29] ON ALL THE NEWS CHANNELS FOR THE
[002:06:39;28] PAST YEAR, AND NOTHING NEW WAS
[002:06:42;02] BROUGHT TO THE TABLE.
[002:06:43;13] I CAN UNDERSTAND -- I WAS A
[002:06:46;00] BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER BEFORE
[002:06:48;01] ALL OF THIS.
[002:06:49;12] I SEE THE APPEAL FROM TRUMP.
[002:06:52;13] FROM SUPPORTERS, I CAN SEE WHY
[002:06:53;04] THEY LIKE HIM.
[002:06:54;14] AND I CAN SEE WHAT PEOPLE LIKE
[002:06:55;13] HILLARY, BUT HILLARY HAS GOT AN
[002:06:57;21] UPHILL BATTLE TO CLIMB WITH
[002:06:58;23] THIRD PARTIES AGAINST HER AND
[002:07:00;20] OTHER BERNIE SUPPORTERS WHO ARE
[002:07:03;29] AGAINST HER.
[002:07:05;14] SO, I JUST THINK SHE MAYBE NEEDS
[002:07:06;06] TO DO MORE TO ACCOMMODATE HIS
[002:07:08;00] SUPPORTERS TO BRING THEM IN.
[002:07:10;16] OTHERWISE, THEY WILL STICK WITH
[002:07:13;28] THE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES.
[002:07:16;18] THEY SHOULD'VE DEFINITELY
[002:07:17;09] INCLUDED THEM ON THE STAGE.
[002:07:17;29] HOST: JACOB TWEETS TO US, EIGHT
[002:07:21;24] YEARS AGO, PEOPLE COMPLAINED
[002:07:23;19] OBAMA HAD NO EXPERIENCE.
[002:07:25;19] IT IS A GOOD THING NOW WHEN IT
[002:07:27;19] PERTAINS TO TRUMP.
[002:07:28;29] NEXT UP IS STEPHANIE, SUPPORTING
[002:07:31;06] HILLARY CLINTON.
[002:07:31;20] YOU ARE ON.
[002:07:32;02] HOST: MY MIND IS BOGGLED BY
[002:07:36;02] THESE PEOPLE WHO THINK FREEDOM
[002:07:36;23] OF LEADER OF THE FREE WILL IS
[002:07:40;20] AN ENTRY-LEVEL POSITION.
[002:07:44;21] SAYING HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE IS
[002:07:45;12] BASICALLY AN ARGUMENT AGAINST
[002:07:46;14] THEIR SUPPORT.
[002:07:46;27] IF WE WATCH TWO -- DID WE WATCH
[002:07:49;20] TWO DIFFERENT DEBATES?
[002:07:52;20] I AM CURIOUS, REALLY.
[002:07:53;21] I AM AMAZED THAT ANYONE WHO
[002:07:54;20] CALLS ON YOUR OTHER LINE CAN
[002:07:56;20] FAIL TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE
[002:07:59;03] BETWEEN THESE TWO CANDIDATES AND
[002:08:01;20] THEIR APPROPRIATENESS FOR THE
[002:08:03;21] OFFICE IF THEY WATCHED THE SAME
[002:08:08;07] DEBATE TONIGHT, UNLESS THEY ARE
[002:08:09;05] PREDISPOSED TO A THIRD PARTY TO
[002:08:12;03] BEGIN WITH, WHICH THE PREVIOUS
[002:08:13;16] CALLER SOUNDED LIKE.
[002:08:14;27] I DON'T THINK EITHER CANDIDATE
[002:08:17;08] IS PERFECT, BUT FOR HEAVEN SAKE,
[002:08:18;27] THAT WAS OAN OVERT, OVER --
[002:08:27;15] NO, EXPLICIT, I'M SORRY,AN
[002:08:32;04] --DISPLAY OF SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT
[002:08:33;17] READY TO HAVE THEIR FINGER ON
[002:08:34;08] THE NUCLEAR CODE.
[002:08:35;00] HE LOST HIS COOL PRETTY MUCH 10
[002:08:37;00] MINUTES INTO THE DEBATE.
[002:08:37;18] HE TRIED TO DEFER TO HILLARY
[002:08:39;19] CLINTON BYA SKIN ASKING IF HE COULD
[002:08:44;11] CALL HER "SECRETARY" AND CAME UP
[002:08:47;13] AS IF HE WERE ADDRESSING AN
[002:08:49;10] ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT.
[002:08:51;02] I AM TRULY BOGGLED THAT ANYBODY
[002:08:53;10] HAS DIFFICULTY DECIDING FOR WHOM
[002:08:55;02] TO VOTE IN THIS ELECTION.
[002:08:58;03] IF YOU WEARE BUYING WHAT HE IS
[002:09:03;04] SELLING, BELIEVE ME, YOU WON'T
[002:09:05;20] GET PAID JUST LIKE THE PEOPLE
[002:09:07;21] WHO CONTRACTED TO DO WORK FOR
[002:09:09;15] HIM.
[002:09:10;12] HOST: THANK YOU STEPHANIE FROM
[002:09:12;22] ARNOLD MARILYN.
[002:09:13;15] THE DEBATE WILL RE-AIR IN 20
[002:09:17;13] MINUTES.
[002:09:20;04] AFTER THAT, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER
[002:09:20;26] TIME FOR YOU TO COMMENT.
[002:09:22;04] WE ESPECIALLY LOOK FORWARD TO
[002:09:24;26] WEST COAST VIEWERS AT THAT
[002:09:26;19] POINT.
[002:09:26;28] ANOTHER TWEET, BOTH CANDIDATES
[002:09:30;07] MADE FOOLS OF THEMSELVES.
[002:09:31;22] HILLARY IS TRYING TO START
[002:09:32;11] ANOTHER COLD WAR AND TRUMP LIED
[002:09:33;17] NUMEROUS TIMES.
[002:09:35;08] PETER: A REMINDER YOU CAN TEXT
[002:09:37;08] IN AS WELL AT 202839.
[002:09:44;07] HERE ARE A COUPLE OF TEXTS.
[002:09:46;07] THIS IS FROM RITA.
[002:09:50;07] DISAPPOINTED THAT HILLARY SEEMS
[002:09:50;29] TO BE A LITTLE BIT REPETITIVE,
[002:09:53;08] VERSUS LACKING REAL ANSWERS.
[002:09:54;08] RAISING MINIMUM WAGE AGAIN HARMS
[002:09:57;16] MIDDLE-CLASS BUSINESS OWNERS.
[002:09:58;21] THIS IS FROM NANCY IN
[002:10:02;11] INDIANAPOLIS.
[002:10:05;10] IT WAS TELLING TO SEE THAT
[002:10:05;29] DONALD CANNOT ANSWER A QUESTION.
[002:10:07;10] HE USED CLASSIC DIVERSION
[002:10:07;29] TACTICS.
[002:10:09;20] THANKS HILLARY, FOR ANSWERING
[002:10:10;29] ALL THE QUESTIONS.
[002:10:12;11] VERY QUICKLY, A COUPLE
[002:10:15;21] MORE TWEETS.
[002:10:17;11] THREE THINGS I WAS CERTAIN OF
[002:10:19;29] AFTER THE DEBATE.
[002:10:21;12] I HAVE NO CLUE I JUST WITNESSED.
[002:10:22;04] NUMBER TWO, I WAS SCARED.
[002:10:23;28] NUMBER THREE, I WANTED MY MOM.
[002:10:26;13] AND CHRISTINA TWEETS IN, STILL
[002:10:28;25] LOOKING FOR THE "HOW TO DEFEAT
[002:10:30;14] ISIS" TAB ON HILLARY CLINTON'S
[002:10:33;28] WEBSITE.
[002:10:34;14] HOST: GETTING A REACTION TO
[002:10:37;14] TONIGHT'S FIRST PRESIDENTIAL
[002:10:38;14] DEBATE.
[002:10:41;14] SUPPORTING  WHO?
[002:10:44;14] WHO IS YOUR CANDIDATE?
[002:10:45;14] CALLER: GARY JOHNSON.
[002:10:46;27] HOST: DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING
[002:10:49;02] TONIGHT ABOUT THE TWO MAJOR
[002:10:50;25] PARTY CANDIDATES?
[002:11:06;18] THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH BICKERING
[002:11:08;29] BACK AND FORTH.
[002:11:09;15] ANOTHER CALLER EARLIER SAID SHE
[002:11:16;23] DOES NOT SEE HOW WE CAN'T SEE
[002:11:17;16] THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.
[002:11:22;15] IT IS HARD TO SEE A DIFFERENCE.
[002:11:25;16] THEY ARE SO SIMILAR IN MANY WAYS
[002:11:28;22] THAT I COULD NEVER IMAGINE THE
[002:11:29;13] DAY WHEN HE WILL BE PRESIDENT.
[002:11:36;18] IT IS HARD TO SEE HIM UP ON THAT
[002:11:41;05] STAGE.
[002:11:47;23] I STILL BELIEVE GARY SHOULD BE
[002:11:50;04] ON STAGE IN THE NEXT DEBATE.
[002:11:50;24] WE SHOULD GET TO SEE SOMEBODY
[002:11:53;03] DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND GIVE
[002:11:55;06] STRAIGHT ANSWERS AND THAT IS
[002:11:56;22] WHAT AMERICA NEEDS SO BADLY
[002:11:58;11] RIGHT NOW.
[002:11:58;22] HOST: THANK YOU, JUST IN FROM
[002:12:01;12] ALABAMA.
[002:12:01;24] BECKY ON TWITTER WRITES,
[002:12:05;24] HILLARY WON THIS ONE.
[002:12:07;24] FROM COULD NOT  -- TRUMP COULD
[002:12:12;09] NOT KEEP TRACK OF QUESTIONS.
[002:12:12;29] MARY IS FROM MA
[002:12:19;25] MARLBOROUGH, MARYLAND.
[002:12:20;12] CALLER: I AM A BIG SUPPORTER OF
[002:12:23;14] HILLARY.
[002:12:23;25] I WILL BE VOTING FOR HER.
[002:12:25;25] BUT IT ALSO PROVED TO ME, WHAT I
[002:12:29;05] HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG.
[002:12:30;27] DONALD TRUMP IS REALLY A
[002:12:33;03] BUSINESSMAN.
[002:12:34;26] HE SHOULD JUST KEEP BUILDING
[002:12:36;26] HOTELS AND RUNNING THEM.
[002:12:37;14] HE HAD TOO MANY BANKRUPTCIES.
[002:12:40;27] WITH REGARDS TO HOW MUCH MONEY
[002:12:44;12] HE MAY HAVE LOANED HILLARY
[002:12:48;29] OBVIOUSLY HE CAN'T BE SUCH A
[002:12:49;22] GOOD BUSINESSMAN IF HE CAN GIVE
[002:12:51;07] SOMEBODY THAT MUCH MONEY AND
[002:12:52;14] THEN HAVE TO FILE BANKRUPTCY.
[002:12:53;05] I HAVETHINK MANY OF THE
[002:12:56;29] QUESTIONS WERE NEVER ANSWERED.
[002:13:00;29] ON AND ON, THEY WERE NOT
[002:13:01;17] ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS.
[002:13:04;29] WITH THE LADY WHO CALLED IN
[002:13:05;19] REFERENCE TO THE MODERATOR I
[002:13:08;06] THINK WHAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR IS
[002:13:08;28] THE MODERATOR SHOULD NOT JUST
[002:13:12;00] YOU KNOW, AS THE QUESTION, TELL
[002:13:12;22] THEM THEY HAVE NOT TWO MINUTES
[002:13:15;07] THAT WHEN THEY ARE GOING FURTHER
[002:13:15;29] THAN TWO MINUTES AND REFUSING
[002:13:19;14] TO STOP BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ADD
[002:13:20;06] ON MORE, WHICH IS MOSTLY WHAT
[002:13:22;18] DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING IS HE
[002:13:24;02] NEEDED TO ALSO BE STRONG ENOUGH
[002:13:27;02] TO USE AUTHORITY SO HE CAN STOP
[002:13:32;02] IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.
[002:13:33;01] THEN IF THEY WERE FURTHER
[002:13:37;20] QUESTIONS TO ASK, IT COULD HAVE
[002:13:38;12] BEEN DONE.
[002:13:38;23] HOST: MARY, ONE OF OUR VIEWERS
[002:13:42;25] TWEETED US AN IDEA ALONG THAT
[002:13:43;16] LINE WRITING IN FUTURE
[002:13:45;17] DEBATES, THE MODERATOR SHOULD
[002:13:46;24] HAVE A CUT OFF LINE FOR THE
[002:13:52;18] MICROPHONE.
[002:13:53;00] CALLER: I THINK THAT WOULD BE
[002:13:54;26] EXCELLENT.
[002:13:57;08] AS LONG AS TRUMP DOES NOT
[002:13:57;27] RUNNING, OR IF WE DON'T HAVE
[002:13:58;26] SOMETHING LIKE AN RUNNING,
[002:13:59;15] BECAUSE EVEN WITH THE MIC OFF
[002:14:02;16] HE WOULD IRRITATE THE PERSON
[002:14:03;06] BESIDE HIM BY SAYING
[002:14:05;21] WHAT HE NEEDS TO SAY.
[002:14:06;10] HOST: TERESA IS UP NEXT.
[002:14:08;20] SHE IS FROM NORTH CAROLINA.
[002:14:11;12] SHE SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.
[002:14:14;15] DID TONIGHT CHANGE THE CAMPAIGN,
[002:14:15;07] DO YOU THINK?
[002:14:16;15] CALLER: IT MADE ME MORE SURE
[002:14:18;24] THAT TRUMP IS WHO I'M GOING TO
[002:14:23;16] VOTE FOR.
[002:14:24;16] HOST: IN WHAT WAY?
[002:14:26;25] CALLER: EVEN THOUGH HE IS NOT A
[002:14:30;17] POLITICIAN, HE DOES HAVE GOOD
[002:14:31;08] COMMON SENSE.
[002:14:32;18] HE HAS GOT A GOOD AMOUNT OF
[002:14:33;18] CONFIDENCE.
[002:14:35;18] HE HAS GOT A BRAIN THAT IS
[002:14:36;07] CAPABLE OF THINKING.
[002:14:39;18] I THINK I SAW A LOT OF
[002:14:40;05] COMPASSION FOR HIM IN THE LOWER
[002:14:43;18] AND MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE, WHO ARE
[002:14:44;10] RIGHT NOW, PURDU WELL
[002:14:46;19] RETTY WELL STRUGGLING.
[002:14:48;20] HOST: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL.
[002:14:50;21] LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF THE
[002:14:53;08] CLINTON FAMILY LEAVING THE ARENA
[002:14:56;08] NOW AND GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL
[002:14:57;00] FOR THE EVENING.
[002:14:57;15] NEXT UP IS A CALL FROM ELIJAH IN
[002:15:01;28] TENNESSEE.
[002:15:02;09] THIS COLOR ALSO SUPPORTS DONALD
[002:15:04;06] TRUMP.
[002:15:04;15] WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT
[002:15:06;01] TONIGHT'S DEBATE?
[002:15:07;02] CALLER: AM I ON?
[002:15:09;00] HOST: YOU ARE ON.
[002:15:11;01] CALLER: I JUST THOUGHT WHEN
[002:15:13;09] HILLARY SAID HE HAD CALLED WOMEN
[002:15:14;24] WRONG THINGS, I THINK IT WAS
[002:15:17;09] UNFAIR BECAUSE IF THE WOMEN ARE 
[002:15:22;04] DOING SOMETHING WRONG, HE SHOULD
[002:15:22;26] BE ABLE TO CALL THEM SOMETHING.
[002:15:23;28] DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE GENDER.
[002:15:26;00] THAT IS BASICALLY MY THOUGHT.
[002:15:26;21] HOST: THANK YOU.
[002:15:29;00] PETER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
[002:15:31;00] PETER: A COUPLE MORE TEXTS.
[002:15:33;00] THIS IS FROM NIGEL IN NEW YORK.
[002:15:35;29] THE DEBATE WAS IRRITATING FOR
[002:15:36;20] BOTH PARTIES.
[002:15:37;03] NEITHER HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS
[002:15:39;14] TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
[002:15:40;03] AND CHENEY IN TEXAS SAYS, STILL
[002:15:43;15] UNDECIDED.
[002:15:45;02] I THINK THE TAX RETURNS MIGHT BE
[002:15:47;18] THE DECIDING FACTOR.
[002:15:48;04] A COUPLE OF ARTICLES IN RELATION
[002:15:50;15] TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TONIGHT
[002:15:51;23] THIS IS FROM THE "FINANCIAL
[002:15:53;03] TIMES" REGARDING THE FEDERAL
[002:15:55;15] RESERVE.
[002:15:56;03] SOME EXPERTS SAY THE FED IS
[002:15:59;10] HONORABLE AND THAT THE POPULIST
[002:16:00;02] ATTACKS FUEL DEMANDS BY
[002:16:02;03] POLITICIANS FOR TIGHTER
[002:16:05;03] CONSTRAINTS ON HIS POLICY
[002:16:06;18] FREEDOMS.
[002:16:06;29] MR. TRUMP "IS TOSSING A LOT OF
[002:16:09;06] FUEL ON THE FIRE," SAYS SRAH
[002:16:12;15] BINDER A PROFESSIONAL POLITICAL
[002:16:16;29] SCIENCE AT GEORGE WASHINGTON
[002:16:17;19] UNIVERSITY.
[002:16:18;10] IT INTENSIFIES THE PARTISAN
[002:16:19;00] CRITICISM OF THE FED.
[002:16:20;10] NOW, "THE HILL" IS REPORTING
[002:16:27;22] THAT MARK CUBAN SENT OUT A TWEET
[002:16:28;29] THAT SAID, "I AM NOT IN THE
[002:16:29;19] FRONT ROW AT THE DEBATE."
[002:16:30;10] HE SAYS HE WILL NOT HAVE A FRONT
[002:16:31;02] ROW SEAT TO THE PRESIDENTIAL
[002:16:32;11] DEBATE.
[002:16:32;21] FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I TWEETED
[002:16:34;11] THAT, I WAS GOING TO SIT IN THE
[002:16:35;03] FRONT ROW.
[002:16:37;12] I DID NOT HAVE A FIRST PROCEED
[002:16:38;04] HE TOOK REPORTERS BEFORE THE
[002:16:40;13] EVENT.
[002:16:41;19] THIS WAS ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG
[002:16:42;12] POLITICS.
[002:16:45;14] SECOND, I GOT TICKETS BECAUSE IT
[002:16:46;06] WANTED TO BRING MY 13-YEAR-OLD
[002:16:47;14] DAUGHTER WHOSE BIRTHDAY WAS
[002:16:49;01] YESTERDAY.
[002:16:49;14] THE DALLAS MAVERICKS OWNER IS AN
[002:16:52;14] OUTSPOKEN TRUMP
[002:16:54;23] CRITIC.
[002:16:56;14] . I KNEW IT WOULD DRIVE HIM
[002:16:57;04] CRAZY.
[002:16:58;14] MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
[002:17:01;15] UNFORTUNATELY, HE WENT ON TO
[002:17:02;05] SAY, WE HAVE BEEN GETTING DEATH
[002:17:02;27] THREATS AND TRUMPIANS HAVE BEEN
[002:17:05;28] TRYING TO HACK EVERYTHING WE
[002:17:08;03] HAVE.
[002:17:08;17] SO, I HAVE HAD TO SPEND TOO MUCH
[002:17:12;02] TIME ON SECURITY AND PROTECTING
[002:17:12;24] MY FAMILY.
[002:17:13;05] I DO NOT BLAME THAT ON DONALD,
[002:17:15;28] THAT IS PART OF THE GAME.
[002:17:16;27] HOST: NOW, WE ARE WATCHING
[002:17:19;05] DONALD TRUMP'S FAMILY LEAVING
[002:17:22;28] HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY.
[002:17:26;05] WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING, WILLIAM?
[002:17:27;08] CALLER: ACTUALLY, GOOD EVENING
[002:17:30;09] AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE
[002:17:33;04] BROADCAST FORWARD FOR THE
[002:17:33;23] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[002:17:34;21] I AM NOT SUPPORTING ANYONE.
[002:17:37;03] I DID NOT SEE, NOR DID I HEAR
[002:17:42;13] ANYTHING BUT THE SAME
[002:17:43;00] COMMERCIALIZED TABLOID ISSUES
[002:17:45;02] THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATED OVER AND
[002:17:45;26] OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BY BOTH
[002:17:47;27] CANDIDATES.
[002:17:49;27] WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
[002:17:51;17] OUR POLITICAL DEBATE SYSTEM.
[002:17:56;29] AS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH MANY
[002:17:58;29] INDIVIDUALS REGARDING THE
[002:17:59;18] COMMENTATOR AND OR THE MEDIATOR,
[002:18:00;12] LESTER.
[002:18:02;01] I BELIEVE HE DID THE BEST HE
[002:18:02;21] COULD.
[002:18:04;00] HOWEVER, WE NEED TO DO BETTER.
[002:18:07;13] AMERICA IS A BETTER COUNTRY.
[002:18:10;00] WE DO NOT NEED THIS TYPE OF
[002:18:12;14] HARSH REALITY TO BE BROUGHT TO
[002:18:15;03] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF THE
[002:18:18;01] UGLINESS OF THE POLITICAL
[002:18:18;20] PARTIES.
[002:18:19;03] WE DON'T NEED IT.
[002:18:21;02] WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.
[002:18:22;03] I AGREE, HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE
[002:18:26;05] PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY.
[002:18:30;05] LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES, SCHOOLS,
[002:18:32;04] INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IF WE CAN'T
[002:18:35;21] GET OUR OWN POLITICAL DEBATE
[002:18:36;11] SYSTEM RESOLVED, HOW CAN WE GET
[002:18:37;14] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO EXTEND
[002:18:41;16] THE TIME AND EFFORT INTO
[002:18:42;06] SUPPORTING ANYONE?
[002:18:46;06] I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, LETTING
[002:18:46;28] ME SPEAK MY PIECE, THANK YOU.
[002:18:48;07] HOST: THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE
[002:18:50;26] CALL, WILLIAM.
[002:18:51;16] ANOTHER TWEET, IT WAS A TWO
[002:18:56;15] AGAINST ONE DEBATE AND MR. TRUMP
[002:18:58;17] STOOD HIS GROUND LIKE A TRUE
[002:18:59;07] LEADER.
[002:19:00;08] THE NEXT COLOR IS ALSO
[002:19:02;08] SUPPORTING -- THE NEXT CALLER IS
[002:19:05;16] ALSO SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.
[002:19:06;08] YOU ARE ON.
[002:19:06;20] CALLER: THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY
[002:19:08;26] CALL.
[002:19:09;05] HOST: YOU BET.
[002:19:11;19] WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
[002:19:12;10] TONIGHT'S DEBATE.
[002:19:13;09] I CALLED ON THE TRUMP SUPPORT
[002:19:16;19] LINE, BUT TO BE HONEST, MR.
[002:19:17;11] TRUMP RAMBLED QUITE A BIT.
[002:19:20;00] I WAS A LITTLE DISPLEASED
[002:19:22;19] WITH SOME OF THE ANSWERS -- OR I
[002:19:25;05] COULD COME OF THE NON-ANSWERS
[002:19:28;26] REGARDING THE CYBER SECURITY
[002:19:29;16] ISSUE.
[002:19:32;14] I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[002:19:33;04] GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO POINT OUT
[002:19:35;03] THAT SECRETARY CLINTON DOES YOU
[002:19:36;14] KNOW IN SPEECH, SUPPORT
[002:19:41;20] SECURITY INITIATIVES, BUT
[002:19:42;09] INACTION, DOES NOT SUPPORT THE
[002:19:43;28] SERVERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
[002:19:45;15] IT GOES COUNTERINTUITIVE TO
[002:19:48;22] CYBER SECURITY.
[002:19:52;29] YOU KNOW, THE EXPERIENCE
[002:19:53;17] QUESTION.
[002:19:54;17] WELL SECRETARY CLINTON WAS
[002:20:00;21] ASKED WHAT HER EXPERIENCE MEANT.
[002:20:03;21] THEY DID NOT REALLY PROVIDE
[002:20:04;11] DETAILS OR ANSWERS OR FACTS
[002:20:06;28] REGARDING THE RESET BUTTON.
[002:20:09;02] I MEAN YOUI K KNOW, THINGS LIKE
[002:20:12;06] THAT.
[002:20:13;21] WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERATOR
[002:20:14;13] IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE, WE DIG
[002:20:18;22] IN, WE DIG IN, WE DIG IN TO MR.
[002:20:23;23] TRUMP WITH REGARDS TO HIS TAX
[002:20:25;23] RETURNS, AND HE SHOULD JUST
[002:20:26;14] RELEASE THEM.
[002:20:27;24] BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE OTHER
[002:20:28;15] SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT TRUMP
[002:20:31;02] SAID WHAT ABOUT THE MISSING
[002:20:34;13] E-MAILS?
[002:20:35;25] WE DID NOT REALLY DIG INTO THAT.
[002:20:37;25] THAT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY
[002:20:38;15] ISSUE.
[002:20:38;25] SO, DEFINITELY A POOR
[002:20:42;01] PERFORMANCE ON MR. TRUMP'S PART
[002:20:43;03] BECAUSE HE DID RAMBLE.
[002:20:45;06] BUT YOU KNOW, I GUESS, THEY CAN
[002:20:49;11] ONLY GET BETTER FROM HERE.
[002:20:53;13] IT IS MAKING A CASE FOR THE
[002:20:55;11] AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE NEED
[002:20:57;08] SOLUTIONS.
[002:20:58;08] WE DON'T JUST NEED TALKING
[002:21:00;21] POINTS.
[002:21:01;01] HOST: THANK YOU.
[002:21:03;01] ON TWITTER HER IDEA ABOUT THE
[002:21:06;19] DEBATES, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
[002:21:08;12] NEED TO ASK THE QUESTIONS.
[002:21:09;20] NEXT UP IS SHANNON, WATCHING IN
[002:21:13;10] GEORGIA, SUPPORTING HILLARY
[002:21:14;00] CLINTON.
[002:21:14;10] WHAT DID YOU THINK OF TONIGHT?
[002:21:16;03] DID IT CHANGE THE CAMPAIGN IN
[002:21:17;12] ANY WAY?
[002:21:18;03] CALLER: UM, I HAVE TO SAY, AS
[002:21:23;16] NOT ONLY A CLINTON SUPPORTER
[002:21:24;06] NOW, BUT ALSO IN 2008, I DO
[002:21:25;19] THINK TONIGHT SHE SHOWED A MORE
[002:21:28;10] RELATABLE SIDE TO PEOPLE.
[002:21:30;25] I THINK THAT A MAJOR PROBLEM I
[002:21:34;22] HAVE, NOT ONLY WITH THE FACT
[002:21:36;14] BOTH HILLARY AND TRUMP HAD A
[002:21:40;17] TROUBLE JUST LISTENING TO EACH
[002:21:41;08] OTHER, WHICH ACTUALLY, COMING
[002:21:44;22] FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, TRUMP BEING
[002:21:46;09] A BUSINESSMAN, I HAVE LEARNED
[002:21:49;12] COMING FROM A FAMILY WHO WORKS
[002:21:50;24] IN BUSINESS, IT IS NOT ALWAYS
[002:21:52;10] TALKING THAT DOES THE BEST, BUT
[002:21:56;00] LISTENING.
[002:21:56;11] I FEAR, AS A HILLARY SUPPORTER
[002:21:59;06] THAT WITH TRUMP NIN LINE TO
[002:22:03;24] BECOME PRESIDENT, THAT WITH
[002:22:04;14] INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS BUT ARE
[002:22:06;21] NOT GOING TO BE WORKING WITH
[002:22:10;14] COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT IS NOT
[002:22:12;01] ONLY ECONOMICALLY, BUT ALSO IN A
[002:22:14;21] LOT OF OTHER ISSUES, SUCH AS
[002:22:15;14] WITH THE MIDDLE EAST.
[002:22:19;14] HOST: THANK YOU, AND LET'S
[002:22:23;06] RETURN TO PETER FOR SOME MORE
[002:22:24;24] COMMENTS.
[002:22:27;29] PETER: I HAVE MORE TWEETS.
[002:22:30;17] IT IS A TRAVESTY THAT NEITHER
[002:22:32;18] JOHNSON NOR THE OTHER CANDIDATE
[002:22:36;01] WERE ON THE STAGE.
[002:22:38;19] WATCHING GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
[002:22:42;28] DEFEND PERFORMANCE OF THE REAL
[002:22:43;19] DONALD TRUMP AESTHETIC, IS WHAT
[002:22:45;08] HE SAYS.
[002:22:46;00] THIS IS MAC ON TWITTER.
[002:22:49;22] THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS MORE
[002:22:51;05] LIKE A ROAS"ROAST" REASON.
[002:22:57;24] "LESTER HOLT, THE THIRD THE
[002:23:03;12] DEBATER?"
[002:23:05;04] THE GAME OF TWO ON ONE SAW
[002:23:09;04] LESTER HOLT ASKED NO QUESTIONS
[002:23:11;14] ABOUT HILLARY'S E-MAILS
[002:23:15;07] BENGHAZI, OR THE CLINTON
[002:23:15;25] FOUNDATION.
[002:23:17;26] WHILE IGNORING THESE ISSUES, HE
[002:23:19;15] GRILLED TRUMP ON STOP AND FRISK
[002:23:21;26] HIS MANY BANKRUPTCIES, WHY HE IS
[002:23:24;17] NOT RELEASED HIS TAX RETURNS,
[002:23:25;24] AND A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES THE
[002:23:29;08] MEDIA SEES AS UNFRIENDLY.
[002:23:30;27] HOST:  NEXT UP IS BOB IN
[002:23:35;10] NORTHPORT, NEW YORK.
[002:23:36;00] WHO ARE YOU SUPPORTING BOB?
[002:23:38;01] CALLER: I AM ACTUALLY SUPPORTING
[002:23:40;20] GARY JOHNSON.
[002:23:41;13] I THINK THAT WITH THE DEBATE, HE
[002:23:47;03] CONFIRMED WITH ME ONCE AGAIN
[002:23:49;09] WE ARE DEALING WITH TWO CAREER
[002:23:51;04] ELITISTS.
[002:23:53;04] I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT
[002:23:56;11] YOU KNOW, WE ARE SEEKING A LOT
[002:23:57;25] OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF
[002:23:58;18] BERNIE SANDERS SWITCHING TO GARY
[002:24:02;06] JOHNSON THOUGH YOU KNOW, ANY
[002:24:04;08] POLITICAL GAUGE ARE ON OPPOSITE
[002:24:07;08] SIDES OF THE AISLE, BUT THERE IS
[002:24:10;09] A LEVEL OF HONESTY AND
[002:24:11;26] CREDIBILITY THERE THAT PEOPLE
[002:24:12;17] DON'T SEE IN THESE TWO
[002:24:16;17] CANDIDATES.
[002:24:16;29] PERSONALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
[002:24:17;21] A LOT MORE OF THAT.
[002:24:21;12] WITH GARY, I THINK THERE IS MORE
[002:24:23;02] SENSE THERE THAT IS IMPORTANT.
[002:24:25;26] I THINK THE DIVISIVENESS WE HAVE
[002:24:26;18] IN THIS COUNTRY NOW REGARDLESS
[002:24:28;27] WITH WHICH OF THE CANDIDATES GET
[002:24:32;29] S ELECTED, THE DIVISIVENESS IS
[002:24:35;02] NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.
[002:24:35;19] HOST: IF YOU WERE ADVISING HER
[002:24:37;05] CANDIDATE, WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE
[002:24:39;17] YOUR CANDIDATE AND YOU RUNNING
[002:24:41;06] MATE TO MAKE POINTS IN THI
[002:24:45;18] S ELECTION?
[002:24:47;18] GUEST: EITHER CLINTON OR TRUMP?
[002:24:50;18] HOST: NO, GARY JOHNSON.
[002:24:53;19] CALLER: OH, I'M SORRY.
[002:24:58;19] I THINK EVERY JOHNSON, HE HAS
[002:24:59;20] EMBRACED BEING SOCIALLY LIBERAL.
[002:25:01;20] HE DOES HAVE CONSERVATIVE VIEWS
[002:25:04;06] FROM A FISCAL POINT OF VIEW.
[002:25:07;20] I THINK WHEN, I MEAN, AS A GREAT
[002:25:09;20] EXAMPLE, I THINK IT IS ADMIRABLE
[002:25:12;01] WHEN HE WAS PRESENTED WITH THE
[002:25:12;22] CASE OF BLACK LIVES MATTER, HE
[002:25:14;03] SAID "I HAVE HAD MY HEAD IN
[002:25:16;27] THE SAND."
[002:25:19;21] AS WHAT I THINK THE OTHER TWO
[002:25:22;00] FROM A CREDIBILITY AND ELITIST
[002:25:25;01] PERSPECTIVE, THEY THINK THEY
[002:25:25;21] KNOW BEST.
[002:25:27;21] AND I THINK GARY JOHNSON INFILL
[002:25:33;26] AND BUILDILL WELLS WOULD
[002:25:39;06] BE OPEN IN THEIR ADMINISTRATION
[002:25:42;14] AND LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE.
[002:25:44;26] I AM JUST NOT CONVINCED THESE
[002:25:46;14] CANDIDATES WOULD DO THAT.
[002:25:47;03] HOST: ON TWITTER SOMEBODY WHO
[002:25:51;27] GOES BY THE NAME -- ACTUALLY, IT
[002:25:54;13] IS SAID, THE BILLIONAIRE WHO
[002:25:56;01] WAITED TO DO SOMETHING
[002:25:58;02] CRITICIZES SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN
[002:25:58;24] AT LEAST TRYING FOR 30 YEARS.
[002:26:01;14] NEXT UP, SAMUEL WATCHING US FROM
[002:26:03;23] KENTUCKY, SUPPORTING DONALD
[002:26:04;13] TRUMP.
[002:26:04;22] THOUGHGO AHEAD.
[002:26:08;05] CALLER: YES MA'AM.
[002:26:12;06] I WAS WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE
[002:26:13;26] CYBER SECURITY SEGMENT.
[002:26:14;14] HOST: PLEASE GO AHEAD.
[002:26:16;07] CALLER: OK, SO BASED ON THE
[002:26:22;06] TALKING, AND IT WENT TO HILLARY.
[002:26:25;06] SHE BROUGHT UP RUSSIA, RUSSIA,
[002:26:25;27] RUSSIA.
[002:26:26;07] SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THE
[002:26:27;06] HCAKSACKS CAME FROM.
[002:26:32;06] I CAME INTO THIS DEBATE WANTING
[002:26:32;28] TRUMP TO WIN.
[002:26:34;07] I THINK  I AM A LITTLE MORE
[002:26:39;26] OPEN-MINDED THAN MOST TRUMP
[002:26:42;28] SUPPORTERS ARE.
[002:26:44;09] I LIKE TO THINK I AM AN
[002:26:46;18] INTELLIGENT GUY.
[002:26:47;10] WHEN WATCHING THIS DEBATE, I DID
[002:26:49;10] NOT KNOW WHERE I WOULD GO.
[002:26:51;10] BUT MAYBE NOT.
[002:26:51;23] I DECIDED, WEBER USES THE WORD
[002:26:55;21] "CHINA" -- I DECIDED, WHOEVER
[002:26:59;24] USES THE WORD "CHINA" FIRST
[002:27:01;25] DURING THE CYBER SECURITY
[002:27:02;14] SEGMENT GETS MY VOTE, AND DONALD
[002:27:06;13] TRUMP DID THAT.
[002:27:06;27] HOST: ANOTHER TWEET, I GET A WHAT
[002:27:12;24] ABOUT THE POOR AND THE WORKING
[002:27:13;15] POOR?
[002:27:15;14] I HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE
[002:27:16;05] WEALTHY AND MIDDLE-CLASS.
[002:27:16;24] POOR PEOPLE VOTE TOO!
[002:27:22;14] JASON, DID TONIGHT CHANGE THE
[002:27:23;05] RACE?
[002:27:23;14] CALLER: YES, MA'AM.
[002:27:25;14] HOST: HOW DID IT DO THAT?
[002:27:28;24] CALLER: I AM SUPPORTING HER
[002:27:32;29] 100%.
[002:27:35;15] I WATCHED THE DEBATE AND SHE DID
[002:27:36;07] A GREAT JOB.
[002:27:37;03] HOST: DID YOU HAVE A MOMENT YOU
[002:27:39;29] LIKED THE BEST?
[002:27:40;17] CALLER: HM?
[002:27:43;19] HOST: DID YOU HAVE A MOMENT IN
[002:27:46;08] THE DEBATE THAT YOU LIKED THE
[002:27:47;09] BEST.
[002:27:47;28] CALLER: HOLD ON.
[002:27:49;28] HOST: OK.
[002:27:50;28] CALLER: HELLO?
[002:27:54;20] HOST: GOOD EVENING.
[002:27:56;03] CALLER: I AM CALLING WITH
[002:27:58;20] REGARDS TO THE PRESIDENTIAL
[002:27:59;10] DEBATE.
[002:27:59;29] I LIVE IN LOUISIANA AND I AM A
[002:28:03;28] SUPPORTER OF MS. HILLARY CLINTON
[002:28:07;01] AND I THINK SHE DID AN
[002:28:08;29] OUTSTANDING JOB TONIGHT.
[002:28:09;21] HOST: WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT
[002:28:12;09] HER PERFORMANCE.
[002:28:12;23] CALLER: EVERYTHING.
[002:28:15;05] HOST: THANK YOU, BOTH OF YOU,
[002:28:17;10] FOR MAKING THE CALL.
[002:28:21;25] NEXT UP IS GEORGE FROM
[002:28:23;02] KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN, SUPPORTING
[002:28:26;02] ANOTHER CANDIDATE.
[002:28:26;17] WHO IS YOUR CANDIDATE?
[002:28:27;04] CALLER: I DID NOT KNOW WHO I
[002:28:30;02] WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR.
[002:28:32;25] MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF
[002:28:36;11] ARE UPSET.
[002:28:36;25] WE THINK THE MEDIA, NOT
[002:28:37;25] INCLUDING YOU GUYS, WE THINK
[002:28:40;09] THEY ARE HIDING THINGS IN THE
[002:28:42;03] ELECTION.
[002:28:42;26] TRUMP BROUGHT UP HACKING THE
[002:28:47;03] DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
[002:28:47;18] WE DON'T KNOW IF HILLARY HAA
[002:28:50;03] CKED IT.
[002:28:53;28] WE DO THING DONALD TRUMP SLAMMED
[002:28:56;14] HER WHEN HE WENT AFTER HER
[002:28:59;17] ON HER E-MAILS THAT DISAPPEARED.
[002:29:01;08] BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW -- UNLESS
[002:29:04;11] DONALD TRUMP IS SOMETHING SO BAD
[002:29:05;07] IN HIS INCOME TAX LIKE CHEATING
[002:29:07;19] THE IRS MS, AND I AM SURE HE DID
[002:29:13;21] NOT GO TO JAIL FOR THAT.
[002:29:14;09] THERE IS NO BOMB IN THERE LIKE
[002:29:16;02] THAT WHERE HE IS GOING TO GET
[002:29:17;21] SLAMMED.
[002:29:18;02] HE REALLY SLAMMED HER BACK ON
[002:29:20;23] THAT AND I THINK PEOPLE -- SOME
[002:29:22;13] OF THE PEOPLE THE THAT AS A WIN
[002:29:24;11] FOR DONALD TRUMP.
[002:29:26;03] HE REALLY TOOK HER DOWN A FEW
[002:29:28;03] TIMES.
[002:29:29;12] THEY WERE SOMETIMES WHEN IT WAS
[002:29:33;03] KIND OF SO-SO AND HE KIND OF
[002:29:34;11] INTERRUPTED HER A FEW TIMES,
[002:29:35;01] WHICH WAS KIND OF UPSETTING.
[002:29:36;15] THAT DID NOT LOOK SO GOOD.
[002:29:39;03] BUT I THINK HE IS VERY
[002:29:39;20] PRESIDENTIAL WHEN IT COMES DOWN
[002:29:40;12] TO ALL THE DIRTY POLITICS ON THE
[002:29:42;18] ADVERTISING SHE IS DOING.
[002:29:45;04] HE BROUGHT THAT UP, WHICH IS
[002:29:45;24] DEFINITELY TRUE.
[002:29:48;04] HE IS BEING VERY, YOU KNOW, NICE
[002:29:48;26] ABOUT IT AND NOT SAYING ANY
[002:29:51;21] REALLY BAD THINGS ABOUT HER AND
[002:29:54;14] TRYING TO MAKE A CLEAN RACE,
[002:29:55;18] WHICH IS DEFINITELY
[002:29:56;04] PRESIDENTIAL.
[002:29:56;17] HOST: THANK YOU, GEORGE.
[002:30:02;08] THIS WILL BE THE LAST.
[002:30:02;25] WE HAVE COMMENTS LATER ON AFTER
[002:30:04;26] WE RE-AIR THE DEBATE.
